# Technical Overview of Ft Series - Ft101

## Introduction
The Ft101 is a cutting-edge device in the Ft Series, designed for comprehensive environmental monitoring. This sensor leverages advanced technology to deliver accurate data while maintaining low power consumption. Key features include LoRaWAN connectivity, easy installation, and versatility in various applications.

## Working Principles
The Ft101 operates on the principle of sensing environmental variables using integrated sensors, including temperature, humidity, and air quality modules. The device collects data from its surroundings, processes the information locally, and transmits it via LoRaWAN. Data transmission occurs at scheduled intervals, or it can be triggered by threshold-based events. The internal microcontroller manages sensor operations, ensuring high precision and reliability.

### Sensor Components
- **Temperature Sensor:** Utilizes a digital thermistor to monitor ambient temperature.
- **Humidity Sensor:** Employs a capacitive sensor for relative humidity measurement.
- **Air Quality Sensor:** An electrochemical sensor detects concentrations of specific gases and particulates.

## Installation Guide
1. **Site Selection:** Choose a location that accurately represents the area to be monitored and is within range of a LoRaWAN gateway.
2. **Mounting:** Use the provided brackets to securely mount the device on a wall or pole, ensuring it's sheltered from direct exposure to harsh weather conditions.
3. **Powering Up:** Insert the recommended battery pack, ensuring proper orientation. The device will power on automatically.
4. **Configuration:** Using the mobile app or web interface, connect to the Ft101 and configure it with the necessary parameters (e.g., data transmission intervals, alert thresholds).
5. **Testing:** Perform a systems check to confirm data is being received correctly at the LoRaWAN gateway.
