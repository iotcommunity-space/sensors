## Working Principles

ZANE - Ztag utilizes LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) to enable wireless communication over extended distances while minimizing power consumption. The device integrates sensors that detect and record environmental parameters, transmitting data to a central server or cloud platform for processing and analysis. The key principles are:

- **Data Acquisition**: ZANE - Ztag is equipped with multiple sensors capable of measuring parameters such as temperature, humidity, motion, and more, depending on the variant.
- **LoRa Modulation**: It employs LoRa modulation to encode the data, achieving long-range communication (up to 10-15 kilometers in open environments).
- **LoRaWAN Protocol**: Operates on LoRaWAN, a protocol that efficiently manages data packet transmission between the device and network server, ensuring secure and reliable data transfer.
- **Adaptive Data Rate (ADR)**: Optimizes data transmission rates and power levels based on network conditions, enhancing performance and battery longevity.

## Installation Guide

1. **Unboxing and Inspection**: Ensure all components are intact and free from damage. The package typically includes the sensor unit, mounting accessories, and a quick start guide.
   
2. **Locating the Device**: Identify an optimal location for installation, ensuring no obstructions interfere with the LoRa signal. The placement should be within the operating range for effective data capture.
   
3. **Mounting**: Use the provided hardware to securely mount the device. Installation options often include pole mounting, wall attachments, or magnetic backings, depending on the model.
   
4. **Powering Up**: ZANE - Ztag is typically battery-powered or solar-equipped. Install batteries as specified, or ensure solar panels are exposed to adequate sunlight.
   
5. **Configuration**: Connect to the device via a smartphone app or PC software for initial setup. Input network credentials, configure sensor settings, and update firmware if necessary.
   
6. **Network Integration**: Register the device on your LoRaWAN network server by inputting the Device EUI, Application EUI, and App Key. Ensure correct integration to enable data transmission.
   
7. **Testing and Calibration**: Conduct a test transmission to verify connectivity and sensor functionality. Adjust calibration settings as required for accurate readings.
