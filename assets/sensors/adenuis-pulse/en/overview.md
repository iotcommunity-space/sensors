# Technical Overview: ADENUIS - Pulse (ADENUIS)

## Introduction
ADENUIS - Pulse (ADENUIS) is an advanced Internet of Things (IoT) pulse sensor specifically designed to monitor and transmit pulse data using LoRaWAN technology. It is tailored for various applications including water, gas, and electricity metering, offering reliable and efficient data transmission over long distances with minimal power usage.

## Working Principles
ADENUIS captures pulse data by interfacing with pulse output devices such as meters. The sensor is equipped with a pulse transducer that converts physical events (such as the rotation of a meter dial) into electronic pulses. These electronic pulses are then processed by the sensor's onboard microcontroller unit (MCU). The sensor aggregates and timestamps the pulses, encoding them into a data packet ready for transmission.

The LoRaWAN module within the ADENUIS takes the processed pulse data, applying any necessary error correction, encryption, and formatting it according to LoRaWAN standards. This formatted data is then transmitted to a LoRaWAN gateway, which relays it to a network server for further processing and storage.

## Installation Guide
1. **Site Preparation**: Ensure that the installation site provides adequate space and environmental conditions compatible with ADENUIS specifications (e.g., temperature, humidity).
   
2. **Mount the Sensor**: Securely attach the ADENUIS - Pulse device onto the pulse-generating meter. Make sure the sensor's pulse transducer is properly aligned with the meter's pulse output port.

3. **Connect to Power Source**: ADENUIS can be powered using either a built-in battery pack or an external power source (ensure adherence to device voltage requirements). For battery installation, ensure correct polarity alignment.

4. **Configure the Sensor**: Use the ADENUIS configuration tool or mobile app to set up the sensor parameters, including pulse input type (active low/high), sensitivity, and calibration settings.

5. **LoRaWAN Setup**: Register the ADENUIS device on your LoRaWAN Network Server. Input the device EUI, App Key, and any other necessary parameters related to your network's security and connectivity settings.

6. **Test Sensor Communication**: Conduct initial testing to ensure data is being sent to and received by the gateway accurately.

## LoRaWAN Details
- **Frequency Band**: The ADENUIS supports multiple frequency bands (e.g., EU868, US915) based on the regional requirements, ensuring compliance with local regulations.
- **Adaptive Data Rate (ADR)**: Employs ADR for optimal data rate settings based on network conditions, maintaining energy efficiency while ensuring robust connectivity.
- **Over-the-Air Activation (OTAA)**: Supports OTAA for secure, scalable network integration, allowing for seamless device joining and activation.

## Power Consumption
ADENUIS is engineered for low power operation, making it ideal for remote installations with limited power accessibility. The device features:
- **Sleep Mode**: When not actively transmitting data, the sensor enters a low-power sleep mode to conserve energy.
- **Battery Life**: The battery life can extend up to ten years depending on data transmission frequency and environmental conditions.

## Use Cases
- **Water Metering**: Provides real-time pulse data for water consumption analysis and billing.
- **Gas Metering**: Offers a robust solution for remote gas usage monitoring and reporting.
- **Electricity Metering**: Enables detailed pulse count data transmission, aiding in energy usage tracking.
- **Irrigation Systems**: Facilitates water flow monitoring in agriculture to optimize irrigation schedules.

## Limitations
- **Line of Sight**: The sensorâ€™s effectiveness might be reduced in environments with significant physical obstructions that can attenuate LoRa signals.
- **Battery Dependency**: Device performance and longevity are contingent on battery life, necessitating periodic checks if the internal battery is used.
- **Environmental Constraints**: Extreme environmental conditions (e.g., temperatures beyond specified thresholds) may affect device reliability and accuracy.
- **Data Latency**: LoRaWAN, while effective for non-critical applications, might introduce latency unsuitable for real-time applications requiring instant data.

With its comprehensive design and reliable wireless communication, the ADENUIS - Pulse provides a versatile solution for various metering applications, promoting efficient resource management and operational insight.
