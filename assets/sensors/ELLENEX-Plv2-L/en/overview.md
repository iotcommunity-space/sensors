# ELLENEX - Plv2 L Technical Overview

The ELLENEX Plv2 L is a precision pressure sensor designed for remote monitoring applications in IoT ecosystems. This guide will explore the sensor's working principles, installation process, LoRaWAN connectivity, power consumption profiles, use cases, and limitations to assist in deployment and optimization.

## Working Principles

The Plv2 L sensor functions based on the piezoresistive effect. It utilizes a piezoresistive element that changes resistance when pressure is applied, allowing for conversion of physical pressure into an electrical signal. This signal undergoes processing to output accurate pressure readings suitable for various applications. The sensor is designed with a robust housing to withstand harsh environmental conditions, maintaining precision and reliability.

## Installation Guide

1. **Site Selection**: Choose a location where pressure monitoring is vital, such as pipelines, tanks, or fluid systems. Ensure the site provides stable mounting points and clear communication pathways for LoRaWAN signals.

2. **Mounting**: 
   - Secure the sensor using compatible mounting brackets, flanges, or directly threaded installations, ensuring it is properly aligned with the flow of pressure.
   - Verify that all mechanical connections are tight to prevent leaks or false readings.

3. **Connection**:
   - Connect the sensor to the system using supplied or appropriate connectors. Ensure all electrical connections are made according to specified polarities to prevent damage.
   - Verify that LoRaWAN communication parameters (like frequency, spreading factor, etc.) are set correctly on the sensor and the gateway.

4. **Configuration**: 
   - Use the provided software tools or mobile app to calibrate and configure the sensor settings to fit the application's needs. This includes setting thresholds for alerts and configuring the data transmission interval.
