# Ws Series - Ws202 Technical Overview

## Introduction
The Ws202 is part of the Ws Series of environmental and condition monitoring sensors designed to provide long-range data transmission using the LoRaWAN protocol. This device is optimized for low-power applications, making it ideal for deployment in remote or hard-to-reach areas. The Ws202 is equipped with multiple sensors to monitor environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, and pressure, which are crucial for a wide range of applications.

## Working Principles
The Ws202 operates on the LoRaWAN network, a protocol designed for IoT applications requiring long-range and low power consumption. The sensor integrates several components:

- **Sensors**: The Ws202 is equipped with high-precision temperature, humidity, and pressure sensors. These sensors operate using capacitive and resistive technologies to measure environmental conditions accurately.
- **Microcontroller Unit (MCU)**: This unit processes data from the integrated sensors and prepares it for transmission over the LoRaWAN network.
- **LoRa Modem**: The LoRa modem modulates the processed data into radio signals and transmits them over long distances. The Ws202 supports multiple frequency bands, enhancing its adaptability for global deployment.

## Installation Guide
### Pre-Installation Requirements
1. **LoRaWAN Gateway**: Ensure there is a compatible LoRaWAN gateway within your deployment area to facilitate data transmission.
2. **Network Server Access**: Access to a network server capable of handling LoRaWAN data packets is necessary for receiving and processing the transmitted data.

### Installation Steps
1. **Mounting**: Securely mount the Ws202 in the desired location using the provided mounting kit. The sensor should be placed in an area with optimal exposure to the environmental parameters it is monitoring.
2. **Power Up**: Insert the provided batteries into the unit’s battery compartment. Ensure correct polarity to avoid damage.
3. **Configuration**: Use the designated mobile or PC application to configure the device settings, such as the frequency band and data transmission intervals.
4. **Network Registration**: Register the Ws202 with the LoRaWAN network server, adding its device EUI, App EUI, and App Key for secure data transmission.

## LoRaWAN Details
- **Frequency Bands**: The Ws202 supports multiple frequency bands, including EU868, US915, AS923, and AU915, ensuring global compatibility.
- **Adaptive Data Rate (ADR)**: The Ws202 supports ADR, optimizing data transmission rates and power consumption based on network conditions.
- **Security**: Data integrity is ensured through end-to-end encryption using AES-128.

## Power Consumption
The Ws202 is designed for ultra-low power consumption:
- **Normal Operation**: Consumes approximately 10µA in standby mode.
- **Data Transmission**: Peaks at 40mA during LoRaWAN data transmission.
Battery life can extend to 5 years, depending on the transmission interval and environmental conditions.
