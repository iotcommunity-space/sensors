## Technical Overview of POLYSENSE - Bidirectional People Counting Sensor End Node Using Diffuse Reflection Technology

### Working Principles

The POLYSENSE Bidirectional People Counting Sensor utilizes diffuse reflection technology to accurately count the number of people passing by a specified area. This technology involves emitting infrared light which reflects off individuals and returns to the sensor. By measuring the time it takes for the reflected light to return and analyzing the angle of reflection, the sensor can determine the movement direction and count the number of people entering and exiting a space.

The sensor leverages an advanced optical system combined with sophisticated algorithms to distinguish people from other objects, ensuring high accuracy in various environmental conditions such as different lighting situations and crowded spaces.

### Installation Guide

1. **Site Selection**: Choose a location that sees frequent foot traffic and provides clear visibility for the sensor. The ideal height for installation is around 2.2 to 3 meters above the ground.

2. **Mounting**: Secure the sensor to a stable surface using the provided mounting bracket. Ensure that the sensor is aligned perpendicularly to the direction of pedestrian flow for optimal counting accuracy.

3. **Alignment and Calibration**: Once installed, adjust the sensor’s position as necessary and calibrate it using the provided software or mobile application to account for environmental factors specific to the location.

4. **Power Connection and Configuration**: Connect the device to an appropriate power source. Configure it using the accompanying user interface, setting parameters such as sensitivity, counting intervals, and network connectivity.

5. **Testing**: Perform a walkthrough to verify that the sensor accurately detects and counts individuals moving in both directions.

### LoRaWAN Details

The POLYSENSE sensor operates using the LoRaWAN communication protocol, allowing for long-range data transmission with minimal power consumption. Key LoRaWAN specifications for this sensor include:

- **Frequency Bands**: Supports various regional ISM bands including EU868, US915, AS923, and others.
- **Data Transmission**: The device periodically transmits aggregated people count data to a LoRaWAN gateway, facilitating real-time monitoring and analysis.
- **Network Configuration**: Supports over-the-air activation (OTAA) and activation by personalization (ABP) methods to join the LoRa network.
- **Security**: Incorporates standard LoRaWAN AES-128 encryption to ensure data security during transmission.

### Power Consumption

The POLYSENSE sensor is designed for low energy use to facilitate extended operation without frequent maintenance. Key factors include:

- **Power Source**: Equipped with a long-lasting lithium battery or support for external DC power options (depending on model configuration).
- **Battery Life**: Capable of operating for up to 5 years on a single battery set under standard conditions, assuming typical usage and data transmission frequencies.
- **Power Saving**: Features automatic sleep modes and adjustable transmission intervals to further conserve energy.

### Use Cases

The versatility of the POLYSENSE Bidirectional People Counting Sensor makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, including:

- **Retail Environments**: Measuring foot traffic in shopping malls or standalone stores to optimize staffing and marketing efforts.
- **Public Transport**: Monitoring passenger flow in subway stations or bus terminals to enhance service efficiency and crowd management.
- **Event Management**: Counting attendees at concerts, exhibitions, or conferences to manage capacity and enhance safety practices.
- **Smart Buildings**: Providing occupancy data to optimize energy use in HVAC systems and lighting controls.

### Limitations

While the POLYSENSE sensor offers robust features, it does have certain limitations:

- **Environmental Interference**: Although designed to cope with variable lighting, extreme weather conditions, such as rain or direct sunlight, could potentially affect sensor accuracy.
- **Obstructions**: Physical barriers between the sensor and the counted area could hinder performance, necessitating unobstructed line-of-sight installation.
- **Data Latency**: LoRaWAN’s long-range communication can introduce a slight delay in data transmission, though typically minimal and non-impactful for aggregate analytics.
- **Installation Complexity**: Proper alignment and calibration are crucial, which may pose some initial setup challenges, especially in complex environments.

In summary, the POLYSENSE Bidirectional People Counting Sensor is a powerful tool for accurate people counting with numerous applications across various industries, though it requires careful installation and consideration of environmental factors.
