- **Sensors**: Detect and measure various physical properties.
- **Microcontroller**: Processes sensor data and manages communication protocols.
- **LoRaWAN Module**: Facilitates long-range data transmission over the LoRa network.
- **Power Management Unit**: Ensures efficient power usage and prolongs battery life.

## Installation Guide

1. **Site Selection**: Choose a location that optimizes sensor performance, considering factors like exposure to the environment and signal reception.
2. **Mounting**: Secure the sensor using the accompanying mounting bracket. Ensure that it is positioned to accurately capture the intended data.
3. **Power Supply**: Insert the batteries provided or connect to a suitable DC power source. Ensure proper orientation of the batteries to prevent power loss.
4. **Activation**: Turn on the sensor by engaging the power switch.
5. **Configuration**: Use the Koidra mobile app or web interface to configure sensor parameters such as data transmission intervals and thresholds.
6. **Network Connection**: Register the sensor with The Things Network (TTN) using the device’s unique EUI and join the LoRaWAN network.
7. **Calibration**: Perform initial calibration if necessary, following the prompts on the configuration interface.
