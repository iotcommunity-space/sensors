# WATTECO - ATMO Sensor Technical Documentation

## Overview

The WATTECO Atmo Sensor is a state-of-the-art environmental sensor that measures various environmental parameters, including temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure. The sensor follows the principles of IoT and utilizes LoRaWAN technology for its operation. 

## Working Principles

Atmo Sensor collects data by utilizing a range of onboard sensors that read different environmental factors. The temperature sensor works by detecting the voltage change across its terminals, which varies according to the temperature. The humidity sensor operates based on the capacitive principle where the change in relative humidity alters the capacitance of the onboard humidity sensor. The atmospheric pressure sensor detects pressure by measuring the deformation of a sensing element due to pressure applied to it. 

## Installation Guide

1. Unbox the WATTECO Atmo Sensor and read through the user manual
2. Appropriately place your device where it can measure the environmental changes (preferably indoors and away from direct sunlight).
3. Power-up the device using a standard micro-USB cable.
4. Connect your device to a LoRaWAN network by following the instructions in the user manual.

## LoRaWAN Specifications

LoRaWAN technology allows the Atmo Sensor to communicate with IoT networks across long distances using low power. It uses unlicensed bands (specifically the 868 MHz band in Europe and 915 MHz band in North America) which means anyone can freely use them without needing special licenses from the government. Encryption keys make data transmission secure.

## Power Consumption

The Atmo Sensor has a remarkably low power consumption due to its use of the LoRaWAN technology. It can function for years on a single battery charge, depending on the transmission frequency. If you need more regular readings, the device can be plugged into a permanent power source via a micro-USB cable.

## Use Cases

1. Indoor Air Quality Monitoring: Atmo Sensor can monitor air pressure, temperature, and humidity to help improve the indoor environment, thus enhancing health and comfort.
2. Weather Stations: In weather stations, the Atmo Sensor can provide real-time data about the local environment.
3. Agricultural Applications: The sensor can be used in agricultural setups to monitor and control atmospheric conditions, improving crop yields.

## Limitations

1. Limited Outdoor Use: The Atmo Sensor is primarily designed for indoor environments. However, with extra casing, it can be used outdoor but there may be a reduction in the sensor's life span.
2. Internet Dependence: The Atmo Sensor relies on a stable LoRaWAN connection. Any interruption to the network would result in the halting of data transmissions.
3. Analytics Feature: The sensor only captures data. For advanced analytical data processing, a separate software application is required.
4. Battery Life: Although the power consumption is low, the battery life does get affected if the reporting frequency is increased or with heavy usage. In such cases, a constant power source is recommended.
