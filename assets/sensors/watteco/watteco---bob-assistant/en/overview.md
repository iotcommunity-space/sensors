## WATTECO - Bob Assistant (WATTECO)

### Technical Overview:

The WATTECO Bob Assistant is a robust, industrial-grade wireless sensor, offering rich diagnostic capabilities. It is designed to analyze and interpret vibrations and temperature on any machine, providing timely and relevant information on fixable issues through its advanced and smart monitoring system. 

### Working Principle:

The operating principle of the WATTECO Bob Assistant is based on cyclic function and event measurement. With built-in 3D MEMS accelerometer and thermistors, it measures acceleration and temperature to gather data regarding machine performance. This data is processed by the device's onboard Edge computing capabilities, and then using an embedded LoRaWAN transmission module, the processed information is sent to the cloud in order to generate predictive maintenance protocols.

### Installation Guide:

The installation process of the WATTECO Bob Assistant is straightforward, with minimal need for technical knowledge. The device has a magnetic base allowing it to be directly stuck onto machines. Post setup of the LoRaWAN, the Bob Assistant will automatically start collecting and transmitting data. User just need to connect it to a LoRa network & define its frequency of measurements.

### LoRaWAN details:

The WATTECO Bob Assistant works over a private or public LoRaWAN network, providing long-range, low-power wireless connectivity. It operates in various LoRaWAN frequency bands (EU868, US915, AU915, AS923, KR920, IN865), which makes it worldwide deployable on any LoRaWAN V1.0.x & V1.1 network.

### Power Consumption:

Power consumption for the WATTECO Bob Assistant sensor is minimized due to its use of energy-efficient LoRaWAN technology. Typically, its lifespan exceeds ten years under normal conditions (temp 20Â°C, 3D vibrations every 15 minutes, temp every 30 minutes, reports every 15 minutes), even with included 3.6V 3500mAh battery with no external power supply.

### Use Cases:

The WATTECO Bob Assistant is ideal for a variety of use-cases across various sectors, including but not limited to:

1. Predictive maintenance in the industry sector to optimize machine health and avoid unnecessary downtime.
2. Energy management to detect anomalies in the operation of an industrial machine.
3. Condition monitoring and fault diagnosis in HVAC systems.
4. Monitoring of the structural health of building components or on any type of equipment installed on a site.

### Limitations:

While the WATTECO Bob Assistant offers many advantages, it comes with certain limitations. It requires a strong LoRaWAN connection to operate. It may not work effectively in regions where LoRaWAN coverage is weak or unavailable. Despite its energy efficiency, the Bob Assistant is dependent on a battery, which will require replacement after its lifespan. The sensor cannot function underwater or in extremely high-temperature surroundings.
