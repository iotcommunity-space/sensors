Title: Technical Overview and User Guide - WATTECO - Pulse Senso Atex Zone 1 Sensor 

1. Overview

The Pulse Senso Atex Zone 1 Sensor by WATTECO is an advanced IoT sensor designed to monitor and transmit status and changes in pulse output meters. The sensor harnesses the reliable and power-efficient Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) technology to communicate over a wide range without compromising the energy consumption.

2. Working Principles

The Pulse Senso Atex Zone 1 Sensor operates by detecting variations in magnetic and electrical fields on pulse output meters. Each pulse corresponds to a specific amount of energy passing through the meter. These pulses are counted, stored, and translated into meaningful measurements which are then transmitted to the centralized application server.

3. Installation Guide

The sensor needs to be installed close to a pulse output, such as utility meters, in an Atex Zone 1 specified hazardous location. Installation involves:

   a. Unpacking the Sensor: Carefully remove the sensor from its packaging.

   b. Positioning the Sensor: Position the sensor near the pulse output source with the magnetic field pointing towards the meter.

   c. Configuring the Sensor: Using the application server interface on a device connected to the same LoRaWAN, configure the sensor according to the user guide instructions, such as setting pulse sensitivity and transmission rate.

4. LoRaWAN Details

WATTECO Pulse Sensor supports the global LoRaWAN standard, allowing for efficient data transmission over long distances. It utilizes the unlicensed sub-gigahertz radio frequency bands, providing communication of the sensor over a 5-15 km range in rural areas and up to 5 km in urban areas, depending on environment and antenna height.

5. Power Consumption

The Pulse Senso Atex Zone 1 Sensor operates on ultra-low power consumption due to its efficient design and transmission technology. It is powered by an internal non-rechargeable lithium battery which can last for several years under typical conditions.

6. Use Cases

The WATTECO sensor is widely utilized in industries where accurate energy metering is crucial. For instance, in manufacturing, utilities, oil and gas industry, the sensor helps in monitoring energy consumption for efficiency. 

It can also facilitate predictive maintenance by analyzing trends over time. These insights enable preventive measures to avoid interruptions and potential additional cost.

Another use case is in safety and hazard monitoring in potentially explosive environments where its Atex Zone 1 certification makes it appropriate.

7. Limitations

While the WATTECO Pulse Senso Atex Zone 1 Sensor doesnâ€™t have many limitations, it is critical to note that:

   a. The sensor is not designed to operate in extreme temperature conditions beyond the range specified by the manufacturer.
   
   b. The internal battery cannot be replaced or recharged. Once depleted, the entire sensor needs replacement.

In conclusion, the Pulse Senso Atex Zone 1 Sensor is an effective solution for monitoring pulse output in hazardous and challenging conditions, contributing to optimal energy use and operational efficiency.
