## WATTECO â€“ Smart Plug Technical Documentation

### Overview:
The WATTECO Smart Plug is a LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) enabled smart device designed to remotely control and monitor power consumption of the connected devices. Its primary working principle is based on Internet of Things (IoT) and communication technologies. 

### Working Principles:
The WATTECO Smart Plug works by integrating LoRaWAN technology, enabling communication between the device and a gateway. This intelligent plug communicates data on power consumption by relying on LoRaWAN's long-range wireless communication platform, connecting to a cloud-based system for data processing and analysis.

The plug is capable of monitoring energy consumption of connected devices, providing real-time data. Further, it has the ability to remotely control those connected devices, switching them on and off as per user commands on an associated app or predetermined conditions. 

### Installation Guide:
Smart Plug installation involves a simple plug-and-play procedure. 

1. Plug the device into any standard power socket.
2. Connect the device you want to monitor or control to the Smart Plug.
3. In order for energy usage data and remote control functionality to work, ensure the plug is within range of a LoRaWAN gateway.
4. After setting up, configure the plug via the associated mobile or web application.

### LoRaWAN Details:
The WATTECO Smart Plug utilizes LoRaWAN, a low power wireless protocol. It provides IoT devices like the Smart Plug with long-range communication capabilities, reaching up to kilometers wide, with minimal power consumption, ideal for battery-operated IoT devices. 

The plug uses various LoRaWAN classes for different functionalities. Class C devices like the Smart Plug employ bidirectional communication, where the plug can receive messages from the gateway at any time.

### Power Consumption:
The WATTECO Smart Plug is designed to be highly energy efficient, consuming only what is necessary to maintain communication with the gateway and perform its primary functions. 

There is also the power measurement feature of the Smart Plug; it measures the energy consumed by the connected devices and sends this data to the server, providing insight into the power consumption patterns.

### Use Cases:
The WATTECO Smart Plug finds usage in several scenarios:

1. Energy Management: Households and businesses may use it to track individual device power consumption for energy efficiency.

2. Remote Control: Ideal for remotely turning on or off devices. 

3. Predictive Maintenance: By monitoring power usage, abnormalities can be detected, ensuring early damage prevention.

### Limitations:
1. The Smart Plug requires connectivity to a LoRaWAN gateway to function. 

2. The device itself does not feature a means of connectivity to consumer Wi-Fi; it relies on LoRaWAN. 

3. It cannot accommodate devices beyond its rated power load. 

4. Smart plugs may not be suitable for every device type. Some devices, like refrigerators, aren't ideal to power down without manually turning them off first, as immediate power restoration could damage such appliances.
