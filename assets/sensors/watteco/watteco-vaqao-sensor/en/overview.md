### Technical Overview of WATTECO - Vaqao Sensor

The WATTECO - Vaqao Sensor is a specialized IoT device designed to monitor environmental parameters and transmit data wirelessly using the LoRaWAN protocol. It is particularly suited for applications requiring long-range communications and minimal power consumption, making it ideal for remote and hard-to-reach areas.

#### Working Principles

The Vaqao Sensor operates on the principle of wireless data acquisition through embedded sensors that measure various environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, luminosity, and more. The data collected is then transmitted via the LoRaWAN network to a central server where it can be accessed and analyzed. The sensor module is equipped with highly sensitive detection components to ensure accurate readings and reliable performance.

#### Installation Guide

1. **Site Selection**: Choose a location within the required environmental conditions that the sensor is designed to measure. Ensure the area has consistent LoRaWAN network coverage.

2. **Mounting**: Securely mount the sensor on a stable surface. Depending on the model, it may be wall-mounted or pole-mounted. Ensure it is not obstructed by large objects that could interfere with signal transmission.

3. **Powering the Sensor**: The Vaqao Sensor typically comes with replaceable batteries. Insert the batteries as per the instructions in the user manual to power the device.

4. **Configuration**: Use the dedicated configuration software to set up the device parameters. This includes selecting the data transmission intervals and customizing alerts.

5. **Connectivity Check**: Ensure the sensor is successfully connected to the LoRaWAN network by checking the status LED or using the networkâ€™s diagnostic tools.

6. **Calibration**: If needed, calibrate the sensor according to the manufacturer's instructions to ensure data accuracy.

#### LoRaWAN Details

- **Frequency Bands**: The sensor supports EU868, US915, and other region-specific frequency bands.
- **Data Rate**: Adheres to LoRaWAN specifications allowing for data rates from 0.3 kbps to 50 kbps.
