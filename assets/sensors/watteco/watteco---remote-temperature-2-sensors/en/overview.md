## WATTECO - Remote Temperature 2 Sensors (WATTECO)

### Overview

The WATTECO Remote Temperature 2 Sensor is an advanced IoT sensor designed to monitor and measure temperature remotely in various environments. The device leverages Low Power Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) technology to communicate with IoT platforms, transferring real-time remote temperature monitoring data.

### Working Principles

The Remote Temperature 2 Sensor uses a thermistor to measure temperature changes in the environment accurately. With two remote probes, it can monitor two different points simultaneously. Changes in the temperature affect the resistance of the thermistor and these alterations are read by its microcontroller. The microcontroller converts this resistance into a temperature reading and updates it in real-time.

### Installation Guide

1. Identify the location where temperature monitoring is required.
2. Fix the sensor probes at the desired locations.
3. Connect the sensor to the power supply.
4. Configure LoRaWAN settings by referring to the manufacturer's guide provided with the sensor.

### LoRaWAN Details

The WATTECO Remote Temperature 2 Sensor uses the LoRaWAN protocol for communication, ensuring long-range and low-power data transfer. It operates in the ISM band, which is free to use without a license, and supports adaptive data rates (ADR) for optimal battery life and capacity. It also supports bi-directional communication, multicast addresses, and repeater compatibility.

### Power Consumption

The sensor operates on a low power budget from a replaceable battery, enabling deployments where mains power sourcing is not feasible. It exhibits an ultra-low-power sleep mode to conserve battery life, which can extend up to 5 years or more, depending on the data transmission frequency and environmental conditions.

### Use Cases

1. Climate Monitoring - These sensors can be used in meteorological applications for monitoring local climate conditions.

2. Monitoring Cold Chain Logistics - Ensuring the correct temperature in shipping or storing temperature-sensitive goods.

3. Industrial Monitoring - Can be utilized for safety purposes due to its accuracy in detecting temperature changes in industrial environments.

4. Home Automation - The sensor can also be used in managing heating or cooling devices in a smart home setup.

### Limitations

1. Environmental Conditions - The sensor accuracy may fluctuate based on severe environmental conditions (extreme cold or heat).
2. LoRaWAN Coverage - Dependence on LoRaWAN network infrastructure may limit use in areas with weak or no coverage.
3. Power Limitation - The sensor operates on battery, and data transmission frequency can considerably impact battery life.

Utilizing the WATTECO Remote Temperature 2 Sensor allows for precise temperature tracking, thanks to its ground-breaking technology, and careful consideration of its limitations will ensure optimal usage in respective use cases.
