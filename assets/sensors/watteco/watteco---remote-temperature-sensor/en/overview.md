# Technical Documentation for WATTECO - Remote Temperature Sensor

## Overview 

The WATTECO Remote Temperature Sensor is a state-of-the-art device that measures and transmits real-time temperature data over long-range, low-power wireless communication technology. With its advanced features, the device provide crucial data for various industrial and commercial applications.

## Working Principles 

The sensor operates by using a thermocouple to measure temperature. The thermocouple creates a voltage proportional to the temperature difference between its junctions. This voltage is then digitized and processed internally within the sensor. The sensor communicates with a network server via a LoRaWAN gateway, enabling it to send or receive data over large distances.

## Installation Guide 

To install the WATTECO Remote Temperature sensor:

1. Mount the sensor in the desired measurement location.
2. Connect the power source to the sensor.
3. Connect the sensor to the LoRaWAN network following instructions contained in the package.
4. Finally, utilize the appropriate software interface to configure sensor settings and collect data.

## LoRaWAN Details

Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) is a media access control (MAC) protocol for wide area networks. It allows long-range communication with low-power consumption which is ideal for IoT applications like WATTECO. The sensor complies with the LoRaWAN 1.0.3 specification and works in the 868 MHz frequency band. 

## Power Consumption 

WATTECO Remote Temperature sensor is an energy-efficient device, designed for long periods of use without a power source change. In sleep mode (no data transmission), the sensor consumes around 15 µA. While during data transmission, the power consumption peaks to around 42 mA. 

## Use Cases 

The WATTECO Remote Temperature Sensor has versatile applications including:

1. Climate control systems in buildings.
2. Industrial temperature monitoring and control.
3. Refrigeration systems in cold chain logistics.
4. Environmental monitoring for agriculture.

## Limitations 

Although the WATTECO Remote Temperature Sensor is a reliable and robust device, it does have several limitations:

1. The maximum and minimum temperature the sensor can measure is within the range of -40°C to 85°C. 
2. Communication could be affected if the sensor is installed inside metal equipment or behind metal panels due to the properties of radio waves.
3. The sensor relies on a LoRaWAN network for data transmission. If the network is down or out of range, data transmission will be affected. 
4. The sensor is not intrinsically safe, which means it cannot be used in potentially explosive environments.

Comprehensive understanding, correct installation and usage of the sensor can ensure optimal functionality and efficiency.
