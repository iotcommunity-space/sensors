## WATTECO Th Sensor Technical Overview

### 1. Working Principles
The WATTECO Th Sensor (Temperature & Humidity Sensor) is a high-performance sensor that measures both ambient temperature and relative humidity. This LoRaWAN device uses a sensing element and an analog-to-digital converter to transform the detected measurement (analog data) into a digital signal. Specifically, the sensor works on the principle of change in voltages to calculate the precise amount of temperature and relative humidity present in the environment.

### 2. Installation Guide
To install the WATTECO Th Sensor, follow the steps below:

- Step 1: Choose an ideal location to place the sensor. Avoid areas with excessive dust, vibration, or moisture.
- Step 2: Secure the bracket to your selected location using the included screws.
- Step 3: Attach the sensor to the bracket.
- Step 4: Connect the sensor to a power supply using the provided cable.
- Step 5: Use the LED indicators on the sensor to verify its status.
- Step 6: Configure the sensor through the LoRaWAN network.

Notice: Always ensure proper precautions are taken while handling the sensor and its installation equipment.

### 3. LoRaWAN details
LoRaWAN technology enables the communication between the sensor and your data management system. The WATTECO Th Sensor specifically uses LoRaWAN class A, delivering features such as long-range and low-power communication, providing secure bi-directional data transfer, and enabling broad network coverage. The unique aspect of LoRaWAN is its ability to provide connectivity even in dense urban or deep indoor environments.

### 4. Power Consumption
The WATTECO Th Sensor has a power supply voltage range of 6-36V. It features power-saving mode and low-energy circuit design, providing extended battery life in comparison to many similar devices. Please note power consumption varies based on the transmitting interval and environmental factors.

### 5. Use Cases
As a temperature and humidity sensor, the WATTECO Th Sensor is versatile for various applications:

- Indoor Climate Monitoring: In residential, commercial, and industrial buildings to maintain optimal environmental conditions.
- Greenhouse Environments: To ensure optimal conditions for plant growth by regulating temperature and humidity levels.
- Food Storage monitoring: Keeping optimal conditions for prolonged food freshness in storage facilities or refrigerators.
- Data Centers Cooling System: Ensuring cooling systems are working efficiently by monitoring the ambient temperature and humidity.

### 6. Limitations
- The WATTECO Th Sensor requires a LoRaWAN gateway within range for operation, limiting its use in locations without this infrastructure.
- Extreme weather conditions may impair the sensor's efficiency or damage it.
- Although the sensor is energy efficient, it requires a power source, which might not be readily available in some remote installations.
- The sensor provides specific data concerning temperature and humidity, hence, for other environment variables, additional sensors are required.
