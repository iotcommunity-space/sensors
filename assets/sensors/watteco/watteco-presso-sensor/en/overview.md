## Technical Overview: WATTECO - Presso Sensor

### Introduction
The WATTECO Presso Sensor is an advanced IoT device designed to monitor and transmit pressure data over LoRaWAN networks. This sensor is ideal for applications in industrial, environmental, and utility sectors, providing accurate and real-time data to enhance operational efficiency and decision-making. 

### Working Principles
The Presso Sensor utilizes a highly sensitive piezoresistive pressure transducer to measure pressure changes in various environments. The transducer alters its electrical resistance in response to changes in pressure, which is then converted to an electrical signal. This signal is processed and calibrated by the sensor’s internal electronics to provide precise pressure readings. The device also incorporates temperature compensation for improved accuracy across varying environmental conditions.

### Installation Guide
1. **Site Selection**: Choose an installation site that is representative of the general pressure condition of the area while avoiding locations subjected to vibrations or harsh environmental elements.
2. **Mounting**: The sensor should be securely mounted using the provided brackets or mounting hardware. Ensure that connections are tight to prevent any leakages or measurement errors.
3. **Connection**: Connect the sensor to the intended pressure line using compatible fittings. Make sure there are no leaks in the connections.
4. **Integration**: Configure the sensor to communicate with your LoRaWAN network by following the manufacturer’s guidelines for network integration, including device activation and configuration via Over-the-Air Activation (OTAA) or Activation by Personalization (ABP).
5. **Calibration (if necessary)**: Although factory-calibrated, recalibration may be necessary depending on specific application requirements.

### LoRaWAN Details
- **Frequency Bands**: The Presso Sensor operates on ISM frequency bands and is compatible with several regional LoRaWAN specifications.
