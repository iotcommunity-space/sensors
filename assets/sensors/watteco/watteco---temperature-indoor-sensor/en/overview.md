## 1. Overview - WATTECO - Temperature Indoor Sensor

The WATTECO Temperature Indoor Sensor is a high-precision IoT device specifically designed to monitor indoor temperature in real-time. The sensor uses a thermistor to measure the internal resistance, which changes based on the temperature, to provide a highly accurate induction of the indoor climate. This data can be utilized for various applications, such as smart buildings, HVAC system monitoring, and environmental control.

## 2. Working Principles

The sensor uses an NTC thermistor, a resistor whose resistance changes significantly with temperature changes. This principle enables accurate temperature measurements. The sensor is encased in a protective housing, designed to shield the internal parts from potential damage or interference, while not affecting temperature measurement.

## 3. Installation Guide

The WATTECO Temperature Indoor Sensor is designed for easy installation. Secure the device firmly on an indoor surface away from direct sunlight or heat sources, using the included mounting bracket. Once mounted, connect the sensor to your device network. The sensor will automatically begin recording and transmitting the temperature data.

## 4. LoRaWAN Details

WATTECO - Temperature Indoor Sensor supports Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) protocolâ€”a low-power, long-range wireless communication protocol designed for IoT applications. LoRaWAN enables the transmission of sensor data over longer distances (up to several kilometers), which is ideal for deployments in extensive facilities.

## 5. Power Consumption

The WATTECO Temperature Indoor Sensor is optimized for low power consumption. Powered by a single lithium battery, it can operate for several years under normal conditions, depending on the rate at which temperature readings are taken and transmitted. The exact battery life may vary based upon these factors, along with environmental factors such as temperature and signal strength.

## 6. Use Cases

The sensor has a broad array of use cases, including:
- Smart Buildings: For real-time temperature data to ensure optimal comfort and energy efficiency.
- HVAC Monitoring: To track the effectiveness of heating and cooling systems and identify issues early.
- Agriculture: For precise climate control in indoor farming and plant growth chambers.
- Cold Storage: To monitor temperature in refrigeration units, ensuring the preservation of stored goods.

## 7. Limitations

While the WATTECO Temperature Indoor Sensor offers many benefits, there are certain limitations:

- Indoor Use Only: The sensor is calibrated for indoor temperatures and not designed for outdoor use.
- Requires Network Availability: The sensor's data transmission requires LoRaWAN network availability. Without a proper network, it cannot transmit data.
- Limited to Temperature Measurement: The sensor only measures temperature and does not gauge humidity or air quality.
- Dependence on Battery: The sensor depends entirely on the battery for its operation. Once the battery power is depleted, it must be replaced for the sensor to continue functioning.
