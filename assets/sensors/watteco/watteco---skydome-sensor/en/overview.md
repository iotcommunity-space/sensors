### WATTECO - Skydome Sensor Technical Overview 

## Working Principles
The WATTECO Skydome Sensor is an Internet of Things (IoT) enabled device, which employs the technology of LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) for wireless communication. The primary function of this sensor is to detect and monitor environmental parameters like temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, and light intensity. It utilizes high accuracy sensors for data collection, and through LoRaWAN, it allows non-stop transmission of these values to the defined network server. 

## Installation Guide

Before installing the sensor, ensure that a LoRaWAN network is available and properly configured. Follow these steps for installation:

1. Locate and secure an appropriate site for the Skydome Sensor. Ensure that it is in a place with good network coverage and can effectively capture desired environmental conditions.
2. Affix the device using supplied mounts, ensuring correct alignment for optimal data capture.
3. Once placed, connect the device to your LoRaWan network. You can do this by inserting a compatible LoRaWAN chip or module into the device, which will be synonymous with your network credentials.
4. Power on the device and validate its connectivity using indicator LEDs or through your network interface.

## LoRaWAN Details
LoRaWAN is an open-standard networking protocol that allows battery-operated devices to wirelessly communicate with IoT applications over long-range, at low data rates. The WATTECO Skydome Sensor is compatible with LoRaWAN classes A,B and C, providing the advantages of wide area coverage (around 2-5 km in urban areas and 15 km in suburban areas) and high energy efficiency.

## Power Consumption
The WATTECO Skydome Sensor operates on low power, maximizing its lifespan while ensuring continuous data transmission. Specific power consumption mainly depends on the frequency of data transmission and the payload size., It is advised to use the power-saving modes and carefully determine the configuration to suit your data requirements.

## Use Cases
The WATTECO Skydome Sensor finds valuable use in a range of applications:

1. Environmental Monitoring: Logging ambient conditions in agriculture, horticulture, meteorology, etc.
2. Smart Buildings: Ensuring optimal indoor conditions for comfort and energy efficiency.
3. Industrial Control: Monitoring of conditions to guarantee optimal operation and security.
4. Research: Collecting high-resolution environmental data for academic or commercial research.

## Limitations
Despite its robust features, the WATTECO Skydome Sensor has a few limitations. 

1. The device requires a LoRaWAN network to operate. In its absence, functionality is limited.
2. Its long-range communication can be hampered by physical obstructions like buildings and trees. 
3. The sensor does not have built-in support for other wireless protocols like Wi-Fi or ZigBee.
4. Depending on the data transmission frequency and payload, the power consumption can be high, reducing the lifespan of the battery.
5. The reported data are purely numerical and may require software for interpretation and visualization purposes.
