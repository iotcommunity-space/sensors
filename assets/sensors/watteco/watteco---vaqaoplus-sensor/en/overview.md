# WATTECO - Vaqao+Plus Sensor Technical Overview

The WATTECO – Vaqao+Plus Sensor is an advanced Internet of Things (IoT) sensor designed to offer exceptional capabilities when it comes to monitoring and reporting aspects such as humidity, temperature, light, and CO2 concentration. This IoT sensor is based on LoRaWAN technology, which makes it suitable for various smart building and smart city applications.

## Working Principles
The WATTECO - Vaqao+Plus Sensor primarily works on four main parameters; light, temperature, CO2 concentration, and humidity. The sensor technology behind these functions allows the device to capture, analyze and transmit data to a central system where it can be easily interpreted.

The sensor captures light data using a photodiode, temperature is measured with a thermistor, humidity is captured with a capacitive humidity sensor, and CO2 concentration is measured with an NDIR CO2 sensor. All these parameters are converted into digital data, processed, and then transmitted wirelessly to the base station using LoRaWAN technology.

## Installation Guide
Installing this sensor is a straightforward process:

1. Unpack the device and review the instructions.
2. Choose an appropriate location for the sensor where it won't be affected directly by external weather conditions and yet remain within reach of the LoRaWAN base station.
3. Secure the sensor using the provided mounting options and ensure it is firm and stable.
4. Set it up by following the provided user manual and connect it with the base station.
5. Test the connection and adjust the setting according to the requirement.

## LoRaWAN Details
The WATTECO – Vaqao+Plus Sensor employs LoRaWAN technology for its communication. LoRaWAN (Low Range Wide Area Network) is a media access control (MAC) protocol for wide area networks designed to allow low-powered devices to communicate with Internet-connected applications over long range wireless connections.

This sensor supports the latest LoRaWAN protocol versions, offering long-range connectivity of up to 10 km in rural settings and 3 km in urban settings, and various adaptative data rates (from 300bps to 5.5kbps).

## Power Consumption
For power, the sensor operates with a 3.6V/3600mAh lithium battery. Under normal usage, the sensor can have a battery life of up to 10 years, which is quite impressive for an IoT sensor. This long lifespan is maintained through its low power consumption design and the efficiency of the LoRaWAN protocol.

## Use Cases
The WATTECO - Vaqao+Plus Sensor can be used in various scenarios:

1. Smart Buildings: The sensor is used to monitor and manage indoor environmental conditions. It can aid in balancing temperature, lighting, humidity and CO2 levels, fostering a healthy and comfortable living and working environment.

2. Smart Cities: The device can be deployed in public spaces like parks or urban areas for environmental monitoring.

3. Industrial Monitoring: In industries, these sensors could be used to monitor and maintain certain conditions which are critical to the industrial process or workers' health.

## Limitations
However, there are certain limitations:
1. Limited aside from LoRaWAN: Although the sensor uses highly efficient LoRaWAN technology, using it in regions with limited or no LoRaWAN coverage might challenge its operations.
2. Non-waterproof: The sensor is not designed to be waterproof. Therefore, it should be placed in areas safe from water to avoid damage.
3. Non-replaceable Battery: The device comes with a fixed lithium battery. Once its lifespan is exhausted, the entire unit needs to be replaced.
   
Overall, the WATTECO – Vaqao+Plus Sensor is a dependable and capable IoT device that can make significant contributions to your monitoring requirements.
