## WATTECO - Intenso Sensor (WATTECO) Overview

WATTECO Intenso Sensor, an Internet of Things (IoT) smart sensor, is engineered to enable the wireless connectivity of physical devices to a digital ecosystem. It employs advanced sensing technology to monitor environmental and equipment updates in real time.

**Working Principles**

The Intenso Sensor operates on the principle of wireless data transmission, capturing data from its environment and sending it to a central monitoring system. The sensor's built-in technology empowers it to pick up changes in temperature, humidity, light, movement, CO2, and VOC (Volatile Organic Compounds). 

Upon detecting these changes, the sensor digitizes the data, encodes it, and then transmits it over the LoRaWAN network to a central server. This working principle allows the Intenso Sensor to provide accurate, real-time data to users, irrespective of their location.

**Installation Guide**

Installation of the WATTECO Intenso Sensor is straightforward. First, identify the correct installation location. Once located, apply the adhesive strip to the back of the sensor and fix it to the desired position. Connect to your network using the sensor's built-in LoRaWAN technology. After installation, configure the sensor through its software interface and then it will be ready for use.

**LoRaWAN Details**

The sensor uses LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) wireless technology. It enables terrestrially and spatially distributed objects to communicate with IoT applications over long-range networks. The sensor's LoRaWAN supports multiple frequencies and has a range of 15 km in rural areas and 5 km in urban areas. 

**Power Consumption**

The Intenso sensor has low power consumption. Operated by a single CR2450 coin cell battery, it's designed for extended operation, achieving several years of autonomy under standard conditions. 

**Use Cases**

The WATTECO Intenso Sensor has a wide range of potential uses. It's widely used in smart home systems for monitoring indoor conditions, as well as in agricultural sectors to monitor environmental factors affecting crops. Industrial applications are also common, where the sensor can monitor and manage equipment efficiency and maintenance.

**Limitations**

Despite its versatility, the Intenso sensor is not without its limitations. Accuracy of readings may decrease if the sensor is installed near heat sources or in extremely damp conditions. Battery performance may also fluctuate depending on the usage and temperature, and could require replacement in under the estimated time. Furthermore, obstacles such as walls, buildings or hills can affect LoRaWAN range. 

In summary, while the WATTECO Intenso Sensor has numerous industrial, commercial, and domestic applications, it's crucial to take account of its limitations to optimize its operation and maintain accurate readings. This advanced sensor fulfils a crucial role in connecting the physical and digital worlds, bringing closer the reality of advanced IoT ecosystems.
