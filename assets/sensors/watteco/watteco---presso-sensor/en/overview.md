### Technical Overview - WATTECO - Presso Sensor

#### Working Principles
The WATTECO Presso sensor is an advanced model designed to sense and measure pressure levels across a wide range of applications. By utilizing a piezoelectric crystal, the sensor converts pressure into an electrical signal that is further processed by its microcontroller for data preparation and transmission. A built-in LoRaWAN module facilitates wireless communication, sending collected measurements to the destined network for remote monitoring.

#### Installation Guide
To install the WATTECO Presso Sensor, adhere to the following steps:

1. **Placement**: Identify a suitable location that requires pressure monitoring. The sensor placement should be as close as possible to the source of pressure.
2. **Mounting**: Mount the Presso sensor onto the desired position. Ensure that the sensor nozzle is correctly connected to the pressure source or pipeline.
3. **Configuration**: Using the recommended configuration software tool, set the desired parameters such as sensitivity, data frequency, LoRaWAN parameters, etc.
4. **Verification**: Once installed and configured, verify the sensor reading manually to ensure proper operation.

Always ensure the device is firm enough to withstand any subsequent pressure changes.

#### LoRaWAN Details
The Presso sensor uses LoRaWAN (long-range wide area network) technology to transmit data wirelessly over a large area. The LoRaWAN protocol is ideal for IoT applications due to its low power consumption and broad coverage. The sensor supports LoRaWAN Class A (default configuration) and Class C, with the potential for integration into any network respecting the LoRaWAN specifications.

#### Power Consumption
Being a highly power-efficient device, the Presso sensor is powered by a 3.6V primary lithium battery. Under standard conditions, and considering two transmissions per day, the sensor is projected to have a battery life of up to 5 to 7 years. Please note that the actual power consumption and battery life can vary based on usage patterns and network settings.

#### Use Cases
1. **Gas Pressure Monitoring**: The Presso sensor can measure and monitor gas pressure in pipelines to detect leakages, inform maintenance schedules, or supply real-time data for system control.
2. **Water Supply Systems**: It can be utilized to monitor water pressure in supply systems, aiding in maintaining optimal pipeline performance and preventing possible damages.
3. **Agriculture**: In irrigation systems, regulated pressure monitoring could facilitate efficient water use, thus leading to cost and resource conservation.

#### Limitations
1. **Signal Range Limitation**: All LoRaWAN devices, including the Presso sensor, have a limitation regarding signal range, which depends on the LoRaWAN gateway's placement and local environmental conditions.
2. **Battery-dependence**: The Sensor's continuous operation relies on battery power. In the absence of a constant power supply, regular battery-change is necessary.
3. **Environmental Sensitivity**: While the Presso sensor is created to withstand a variety of harsh conditions, extremely aggressive environments could potentially harm the sensor’s performance and lifespan.
4. **Limited Pressure Scope**: The sensor covers a broad range of pressure, but beyond that scale, it may deliver inaccurate results or even possibly cause mechanical failure. It is crucial to ensure the sensor alignment with the specific application's pressure range.
  
In conclusion, thoughtful installation, accurate configuration, and regular maintenance, are critical to sustain the WATTECO Presso sensor’s performance and longevity.
