## **WATTECO - Pulse Senso Sensor Technical Documentation**

### **1. Overview**

The Pulse Senso Sensor from WATTECO is a state-of-the-art IoT device engineered to accurately measure and transmit data such as energy consumption levels, utility meter readouts and numerous other variables from an extensive range of devices. The sensor uses time-interval pulse counting to accomplish its tasks. 

### **2. Working Principles**

Pulse Senso Sensor interprets and digitizes pulse output from various utilities and IoT devices. The advantage of this method is that it allows the sensor to measure energy consumption levels from any device, provided it generates a pulse output. The sensor counts and collects these pulses over a given time period and then processes this data to create meaningful information which can be utilized for monitoring and control purposes.

### **3. Installation Guide**

Configuring the Pulse Senso sensor requires a few essential steps:

- Identify the equipment from which the pulse output will be obtained.
- Establish a physical connection between the sensor and the device. Attach the pulse output terminal of the device to the sensorâ€™s input terminal.
- Configure communication settings, such as LoRaWAN parameters, through WATTECO's software interface.
- Place the sensor within an efficient range of a LoRaWAN gateway to ensure continuous communication.

### **4. LoRaWAN Details**

LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) represents a vital feature of the Pulse Senso sensor. This technology enables secure, bi-directional, and low-power communication over long distances. The Pulse Senso sensor, classified as a Class A LoRaWAN device, alternates between active and idle modes, thus enabling efficient power management.

### **5. Power Consumption**

The Pulse Senso sensor is a battery-powered device. Its power consumption is dependent on usage and communication frequency. Functioning on LoRaWAN, the device performs efficient power management ensuring prolonged device life. 

### **6. Use Cases**

Common use cases for the WATTECO Pulse Senso sensor include:

- Energy Management: By monitoring and measuring energy consumption levels from various resources such as water, gas, or electricity meters.

- Smart Grid: Facilitating easy integration into smart grid infrastructure by providing real-time updates and precise measurements for energy consumption.

- Facility Management: Systems can be routinely monitored and controlled effectively using the data provided by these sensors.

### **7. Limitations**

While the Pulse Senso sensor by WATTECO is a versatile device, there are some limitations:

- Devices need to be within an effective range of a LoRaWAN gateway for continuous operation.

- The sensor must have a pulse output interface to interact with other devices. If this interface is not available, the device cannot be monitored.

- Battery life, while optimized, is still dependent on usage frequency and communication settings. Therefore, it's essential to ensure that these settings are optimally configured.
  
The WATTECO Pulse Senso sensor combines flexibility, energy efficiency, and precision to construct a reliable data measurement system. However, optimal performance is contingent upon proper installation, configuration, and appropriate use within its intended environment.
