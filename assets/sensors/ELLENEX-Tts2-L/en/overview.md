### Technical Overview: ELLENEX - Tts2 L

#### Introduction
The ELLENEX Tts2 L is a high-precision IoT sensor designed for environmental and industrial monitoring applications. It is engineered to measure temperature and tilt accurately, enabling remote data collection and analysis via LoRaWAN connectivity. This document provides a comprehensive overview of its working principles, installation procedures, LoRaWAN specifications, power consumption, potential use cases, and limitations.

#### Working Principles
The ELLENEX Tts2 L combines a temperature sensor and a tilt sensor within a compact and robust housing. 

- **Temperature Measurement**: The device uses a thermistor-based sensor to detect temperature changes. The resistance of the thermistor varies with temperature, which is then converted into a readable temperature value by the internal microprocessor.

- **Tilt Measurement**: The tilt sensing is conducted using a MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) accelerometer. It measures changes in angle with respect to the gravitational axis, providing precise tilt readings across two axes (X and Y).

Data obtained from these sensors is processed by an integrated microcontroller that formats and transmits the data via the LoRaWAN network.

#### Installation Guide
1. **Site Selection**: Choose a location that represents the environmental conditions being monitored. Ensure it is within the range of a LoRaWAN gateway to ensure reliable data transmission.

2. **Mounting**: Use the provided mounting brackets and screws to securely fix the sensor. Orient the device to ensure unobstructed exposure to monitored conditions and no significant interference that could affect tilt measurements.

3. **Power Setup**: Since the Tts2 L typically comes with a battery, ensure that it is fully charged or replace it with a new one as necessary before installation.

4. **Configuration**: Program the sensor using the associated software or mobile app by connecting via Bluetooth or USB (according to model specifications). Set the reporting interval, network keys, and other configuration settings.

5. **Network Connection**: Register the sensor on the LoRaWAN network server using its unique device EUI provided on the sensor's body or documentation.

6. **Testing**: Conduct a test transmission to verify that data is being sent and received at the expected intervals. Adjust setup as necessary to ensure optimum operation.

#### LoRaWAN Details
- **Frequency Bands**: Operates in standard LoRaWAN frequency bands such as EU868, US915, or AS923 (dependent upon regional compliance).
- **Data Rate**: Supports variable spreading factors (SF7 to SF12) allowing for scalable data rates and range capabilities.
- **Security**: Implemented with AES-128 encryption for secure data communication.
- **Class Type**: Typically supports Class A, ensuring energy efficiency through lowest energy consumption with scheduled downlink windows after uplink transmission.
- **Integration**: Compatible with most LoRaWAN network servers, offering flexible integration into existing IoT infrastructures.

#### Power Consumption
The sensor is designed for low power consumption, maximizing battery life for extended field operations. This is achieved by:
- Utilizing energy-efficient components and optimizing transmission intervals.
- Power consumption is substantially reduced in idle mode with active mode power strategies during data transmission and processing.
- Depending on settings, the battery life can exceed several years under normal conditions.

#### Use Cases
- **Structural Health Monitoring**: Monitoring buildings, bridges, or other structures for tilt changes indicating potential structural issues.
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Collecting temperature data for weather stations or climate research.
- **Industrial Equipment Monitoring**: Observing machinery and equipment to detect abnormal tilting or temperature conditions that could indicate malfunction.

#### Limitations
- **Line of Sight**: Optimal LoRaWAN transmission requires unobstructed line of sight to a gateway; dense urban environments or underground installations may require additional gateways or alternative configurations.
- **Temperature Range**: Performance may vary at extreme temperatures beyond specified operating ranges.
- **Update Frequency**: There could be limitations in update frequency due to LoRaWAN duty cycle restrictions, affecting real-time data needs.
- **Power Supply**: Long-term unattended operation is dependent on battery life, which may vary based on environmental factors and usage patterns.

This overview should provide essential guidance on the ELLENEX Tts2 Lâ€™s capabilities and optimal usage conditions, aiding decision-makers and technicians in deploying the sensor effectively within their applications.
