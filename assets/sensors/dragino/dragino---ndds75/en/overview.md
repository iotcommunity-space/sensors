### DRAGINO - Ndds75 (DRAGINO) Overview

#### Working Principles:

The DRAGINO - Ndds75 functions as a Class-A LoRaWAN end-device sensor which collects and transmits data to the gateway using the LoRaWAN protocol. The sensor operates on a send-data-then-sleep-cycle to ensure efficient use of power and enhance device longevity. It integrates a low-power micro-controller, LoRa transceiver and a unidirectional pulse counter to enable its core functionality.

#### Installation Guide:

1. Unbox the DRAGINO - Ndds75 device and check for the accompanying accessories including antenna, user manual, etc.
2. Connect the antenna to the device and tighten it securely to ensure an optimal signal reception.
3. Install the battery in the device. The DRAGINO - Ndds75 uses a 3.6V ER AA battery type.
4. Configure the frequency band, OTAA parameters and upload interval according to the settings of your LoRaWAN network server. This is usually done through a PC connection and a communication software.
5. Place the device at your desired location within a reasonable distance from the LoRaWAN network gateway to ensure maximum signal availability.

#### LoRaWAN Details:

The DRAGINO - Ndds75 uses the LoRaWAN Class A protocol, making it compatible with all global LoRaWAN frequency bands. It also supports Over-The-Air Activation (OTAA) and Adaptive Data Rate (ADR).

#### Power Consumption:

The DRAGINO - Ndds75 sensor is optimized for low power consumption and long battery life. The exact power consumption varies based on the set transmission intervals and payload sizes. The device enters a sleep mode between transmissions to save power.

#### Use Cases:

1. Utility Metering: Can be used to monitor water, gas, and electricity usage in homes or businesses.
2. Smart Agriculture: Can help in monitoring soil moisture, temperature, etc., assisting in precision farming.
3. Industrial Automation: Can be used to oversee industrial processes including real-time tracking of equipment usage and worker efficiency.

#### Limitations:

1. Signal Range: The device's performance is dependent on its proximity to the LoRaWAN network gateway. Barriers such as walls may also affect signal strength.

2. Battery Life: While the device is designed to be energy efficient, battery life will depend on the configuration of data transmission intervals and environmental factors.

3. Environmental Resistance: The sensor is not designed to be waterproof or resistant to extreme weather conditions. Therefore, if itâ€™s placed in challenging external environments, the overall longevity and performance could be affected.
