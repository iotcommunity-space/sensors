## DRAGINO - LDDS75 Technical Overview

### Working Principle
The Dragino LDDS75 is an IoT (LoRa/LoRaWAN) device loaded with technology for distance detecting. It functions on an ultrasonic ranging module to calculate the range or distance from one object to another. The ultrasonic module generates sound waves at frequencies beyond the range of human hearing, which bounce off an object and return to the sensor. The time difference between sending and receiving the wave is used to calculate the distance. 

### Installation Guide
1. Insert the Distance Sensor, LoRa module and the battery into their respective slots. 
2. Programme the device by identifying the bands that it will work with.
3. Adjust related parameters such as transmission power, transmission speed, and transmission cycles.
4. Mount the LDDS75 device at the location where you want to monitor the distance.
5. Connect the LDDS75 device to a LoRaWAN network by joining OTAA or ABP. 

### LoRaWAN Details
Dragino LDDS75 uses LoRa wireless technology and complies with the LoRaWAN Class A protocol. Its communication range can reach 2~10 km depending on the specific environment. The device offers functions like adaptive data rate (ADR), confirmed unconfirmed messages, and channels frequency modification.

### Power Consumption
Dragino LDDS75 operates on power-saving mode when it's not in use. The device consumes significantly less power during sleep mode. The precise power hinges on the frequency of data transmitted and received. 

### Use Cases
These devises are suited for applications such as:
1. Level monitoring within storage tanks
2. Distance measuring in reservoirs or dams, etc.
3. Smart parking management
4. Garbage management and monitoring
5. Industrial automation

### Limitations
1. The LDDS75 device is designed mainly for outdoor use. Indoor use may affect the device's transmission capacity. 
2. LoRa communication range relies significantly on specific environment, objects in the path between the device and gateway can decrease the communication range.
3. The maximum range offered by LDDS75 device is restricted to the line-of-sight principle.
4. The ultrasonic sensor might malfunction when there are obstacles in its path. 

In conclusion, the Dragino LDDS75 is an important device with a broad range of applications. However, its full potential and functionality can only be achieved when appropriately installed and when all technical considerations have been taken into account.
