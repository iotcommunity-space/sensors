Technical Overview for DRAGINO - Lgt 92

Introduction:
The DRAGINO LGT-92 is an open source Global Positioning System (GPS) LoRa Tracker that is implemented with a solution of Low Power Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN). It is designed for asset tracking, pet tracking, vehicle positioning, personnel location and various other applications that require live tracking data.

Working Principles:
The LGT-92 device has a built-in GPS module to provide real-time position information comprehensively. Once operational, it uses Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN), a protocol designed for low-bit-rate communication with internet-of-things (IoT) devices over long distances, to send these location updates. The device comprises of a built-in accelerometer and motion sensor, enabling smart tracking capabilities with power conservation.

Installation Guide:
1. Batteries: Install the 3.7V rechargeable Li-SiPo battery provided with the device.
2. Install SIM: Insert a standard LoRaWAN SIM card.
3. Device Programming: Use a micro-USB cable to connect the device to a computer and set up the desired parameters.
4. LoRaWAN Configuration: The LoRaWAN parameters should be configured appropriately to make sure the device communicates with the correct network server.

LoRaWAN Details:
The DRAGINO LGT-92 utilizes the LoRaWAN protocol, operating in the ISM band. It supports several classes like A, B, and C and includes a range of data rates from 0.3 kbps to 50 kbps, ensuring wide geographic coverage.

Power Consumption:
Powered by a 3.7V rechargeable Li-SiPo 3400 mAh battery, it ensures long-lasting operation. Power consumption depends on usage and reporting frequency, but with a 2-minute update interval, the battery life can extend to 10 days.

Use Cases:
1. Asset Tracking: Track and manage your assets in real time, from machinery, tools, or other valuable items.
2. Pet Tracking: Keep an eye on pets and make sure they are safe and sound.
3. Vehicle Positioning: Track the movement and location of a vehicle.
4. Personnel Tracking: Keep track of the whereabouts of personnel in large sites like mining or construction areas.

Limitations:
1. Range: LoRaWAN technology provides long-range communication, but physical obstructions can impact range and performance.
2. Battery-Life: The battery life relies heavily on the update frequency, and frequent location updates can quickly drain the battery.
3. Environmental Limitations: Though it comes with an IP65 waterproof casing, extreme conditions might impact the device's performance.
