## DRAGINO - Ldds04 Technical Overview

### Working Principles

The DRAGINO Ldds04, also known as Dragino LoRa Discrete Level Sensor, is an IoT device that utilizes LoRaWAN technology for communication. Its primary function is to measure discrete liquid levels within a tank and report these levels via LoRaWAN protocol to a network server.

It uses capacitive sensing technology to determine the liquid level, which essentially measures the dielectric constant of the surroundings. It compares the dielectric constant of air to that of the liquid to calculate the liquid level.

### Installation Guide

1. Open the lid of your liquid tank.
2. Install the sensor vertically into the tank so that the sensor head touches the base of the tank. Ensure that the sensor cable runs outside the tank.
3. Tighten the three nuts to secure the sensor.
4. Perform physical configuration for the following: Frequency Bands, LoRaWAN version, Network Keys, and more.
5. Connect the jumper cable to your chosen power supply (battery or USB).
6. Install your Ldds04 in the field, update LoRaWAN settings, and update Test Level as Tool Menu instructs.

### LoRaWAN Details

The DRAGINO Ldds04 communicates with the network server via LoRaWAN class A protocol. This allows the sensor to work efficiently with low power consumption and long range. The sensor can be configured to operate in different frequency bands suitable for different countries' regulations, such as EU868, US915, AU915, etc. Furthermore, it supports adaptive data rate (ADR) and can optimize data transmission based on network conditions.

### Power Consumption

The DRAGINO Ldds04 is known for its low power consumption. Power consumption depends on the task performed: transmitting or idling. For transmitting, it consumes about 120mAh and during idle mode, power consumption is as low as about 12mAh. With a power supply of 2 x 3.6V ER14505 (AA type), it can last up to 10 years depending on the data transmission frequency.

### Use Cases

1. Industrial: For monitoring liquid levels in manufacturing processes.
2. Waste Management: To measure level of waste in dustbins for efficient collection routes.
3. Water Management: Monitoring water levels in reservoirs, canals or dams.
4. Agriculture: Managing water or feedstock levels in agricultural settings.

### Limitations

1. Depth Limitation: The maximum liquid depth it can measure is limited to 4 meters.
2. Specific Liquids: The sensor might not yield accurate measurements with highly corrosive or high temperature liquids.
3. Connectivity: The sensor requires an in-range LoRaWAN gateway to send data, therefore coverage could be a limitation.
4. No Real-Time Streaming: Since it uses LoRaWAN, it cannot provide continuous real-time monitoring due to duty cycle limitations. It relies on scheduled data reporting. 

In conclusion, the DRAGINO Ldds04 is a versatile sensor for liquid level measurement in a variety of settings. For best performance, its limitations must be considered and it should be installed properly according to the manufacturers' recommendations.
