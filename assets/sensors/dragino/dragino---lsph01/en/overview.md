# DRAGINO - LoRaWAN Soil Humidity and Temperature Sensor - LSPH01

## Overview

DRAGINO - LSPH01 is a LoRaWAN Soil Humidity and Temperature Sensor produced by Dragino Technology. With advanced functionalities, this product is designed for smart agriculture, precision farming, environmental technology and data collection in research scenarios.

## Working Principles

The LSPH01 operates using the LoRaWAN protocol connecting to a gateway using radio frequency to send data over the network. This IoT device incorporates a soil temperature and humidity sensor for precise measurements. The sensor uses an electrical capacitance method to measure soil moisture levels and a Negative Temperature Coefficient (NTC) thermistor to calculate soil temperature. 

## Installation Guide

The complete installation involves setting up the sensor, activating the LoRaWAN device and finally, transmitting data to the network server.

1. **Sensor Setup**: Position the sensor in the desired area within the soil. Consult the user manual to ensure the sensor is positioned appropriately for optimal readings.

2. **Device Activation**: Activate the device using the Over-the-Air Activation (OTAA) or Activation by Personalization (ABP) methods. This should involve filling the relevant fields including Device EUI, Application EUI and App Key (for OTAA), or Device Address, NS_KEY, and AS_KEY (for ABP).

3. **Data Transmission**: Once the device is activated, it automatically starts sending data to the LoRaWAN network server. The RF Transmit Power is up to 20dBm, which is adequate for most typical applications.

## LoRaWAN Details

The LSPH01 operates on LoRaWAN protocol class A, which optimizes the device's power consumption and maximizes its battery life. It supports multiple regional frequency bands: IN865, EU868, AU915, US915, KR920, AS923, and CN470.

## Power Consumption

The LSPH01 is engineered for the conservation of energy. It has a sleep mode which significantly lowers power consumption when no sensing tasks are performed. Powered by a 4000mAh non-chargeable battery, it ensures smoother, uninterrupted operations. The device consumes approximately 80 Î¼A of current in sleep mode and around 120 mA during data transmission.

## Use Cases

The LSPH01 is useful in:

- **Smart Agricultural Practices**: Can be used by farmers to monitor soil conditions and make data-driven decisions.
- **Climate Research**: Utilized by researchers to gather extensive data on soil temperature and humidity patterns.
- **Environmental Conservation**: Useful for environment conservators, forestry management and in conservation projects that require ongoing data collection and monitoring.

## Limitations

- The LSPH01 needs to be within range of a LoRaWAN gateway to operate effectively. The range can be affected by different environmental factors and landscapes.
- The battery is non-chargeable. Once depleted, it requires manual replacement.
- The sensor readings could be affected by extreme environmental conditions. Thus, proper calibration, installation, protection and regular maintenance are essential to ensure accurate data.
- Interference from other devices operating in the same frequency band may affect the device operation and data transmission.
