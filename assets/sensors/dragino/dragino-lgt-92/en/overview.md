# Technical Overview for DRAGINO LGT-92 GPS Tracker

The DRAGINO LGT-92 is a compact GPS tracker that integrates LoRaWAN technology. It is designed for tracking and location-based IoT applications with low power consumption and wide coverage. The LGT-92 is ideal for various asset tracking scenarios, offering high reliability and ease of operation.

## Working Principles

The LGT-92 operates by acquiring GPS signals to determine its precise location coordinates and utilizes the LoRaWAN network to transmit this data. The device collects data from the GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) to determine position and speed, then sends this data via the LoRaWAN network to a server or cloud platform for processing and monitoring.

### Key Features:
- **GPS Module:** Used for acquiring location data.
- **LoRa Module:** For long-range, low-power communication.
- **Motion Sensor:** To detect movement and save energy by switching between active and sleep modes.
- **Built-in Battery:** Rechargeable lithium battery that provides extended operation time.

## Installation Guide

1. **Unboxing and Preparation:**
   - Ensure you have all components: the LGT-92 device, micro USB cable, and user manual.
   - Charge the device using the micro USB cable for at least 12 hours before first use.

2. **LoRaWAN Configuration:**
   - Access the device via a serial interface (using software such as Putty or Tera Term).
   - Enter the deviceâ€™s LoRaWAN parameters: DevEUI, AppEUI, and AppKey as provided by your network provider.
   - Choose the appropriate frequency band according to regional regulations (e.g., EU868, US915).

3. **GPS Activation:**
   - The GPS function is activated by default. Verify its operational status via serial commands if necessary.

4. **Mounting:**
   - Place the tracker on or inside the object you want to track (vehicles, shipping containers, etc.). Ensure that the GPS module is exposed for better satellite signal reception.

5. **Testing:**
   - Verify successful data transmission to the LoRaWAN network by checking logs on the network server.

## LoRaWAN Details

- **Frequency Bands:** Supports multiple bands including EU868, US915, AU915, AS923, and CN470, allowing for global usage.
- **Activation:** Can be configured for OTAA (Over The Air Activation) or ABP (Activation By Personalization) modes.
- **Network Server Compatibility:** Compatible with various network servers including TTN, ChirpStack, and Actility.
- **Data Transmission:** Can transmit both GPS data and status information (e.g., battery level) at configurable intervals.

## Power Consumption

- **Battery Life:** The device is equipped with a 1000 mAh rechargeable lithium battery.
- **Power Saving Modes:** 
  - During motion, the device remains active for real-time tracking.
  - When stationary, it switches to a sleep mode to extend battery life.
- **Estimated Operational Time:** With optimal configuration, standby time can reach several months, and active tracking can last days to weeks depending on the reporting frequency.

## Use Cases

- **Asset Tracking:** Monitor the location of moving and stationary assets such as vehicles, machinery, and shipping containers.
- **Fleet Management:** Manage vehicle fleet operations by providing precise location data.
- **Logistics:** Improve logistics operations through real-time location tracking of packages and cargos.
- **Safety and Security:** Track personal safety devices or monitor the location of personnel in distress situations.

## Limitations

- **Signal Interference:** Efficacy can be impacted by GPS signal obstruction or interference in environments with dense structures or heavy foliage.
- **LoRaWAN Network Dependency:** Requires reliable access to a LoRaWAN network for data transmission.
- **Battery Life:** Frequent reporting will deplete the battery faster, requiring more frequent charging or battery replacement.
- **Coverage Limitation:** While LoRaWAN provides wide-area coverage, the exact range is subject to environmental conditions and network infrastructure.

In summary, the DRAGINO LGT-92 offers an effective solution for GPS tracking with low power consumption and wide-area coverage using LoRaWAN technology. Proper installation and configuration are crucial for optimal performance to meet specific tracking needs.
