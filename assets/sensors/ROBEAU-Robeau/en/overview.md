## Technical Overview of ROBEAU - Robeau

ROBEAU is an advanced IoT solution designed to optimize water management by providing real-time monitoring and analysis of water usage. The device employs state-of-the-art sensor technology to offer insights into water consumption patterns, detect leaks, and promote efficient water use.

### Working Principles

ROBEAU operates by utilizing flow sensors to measure water consumption. It connects to water pipes, capturing data on the volume of water passing through. The device uses ultrasonic or electromagnetic flow measurement techniques, which ensure high accuracy and reliability. Data collected is processed and transmitted wirelessly via the LoRaWAN communication protocol to a cloud-based platform, where it can be visualized and analyzed by end-users.

### Installation Guide

**Step 1: Site Preparation**
- Identify the location: Select a location with good access to the main water supply pipe.
- Ensure compatibility: Verify the sensor is compatible with the diameter of the pipe.

**Step 2: Hardware Installation**
- Shut off the water supply.
- Mount the sensor on the pipe using the provided clamps or mounting kits.
- Connect the sensor securely to avoid leaks and ensure accurate readings.

**Step 3: Configuration**
- Power on the device.
- Allow communication initiation with the LoRaWAN network. Ensure the LoRaWAN gateway is within range for seamless data transmission.
- Use the accompanying mobile or web app to register the device, input network credentials, and configure settings.

**Step 4: Testing**
- Turn the water supply back on.
- Verify the data transmission by checking the initial readings on the application.
- Ensure that all sections are properly sealed to prevent leaks.

### LoRaWAN Details

ROBEAU uses the LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) protocol for its data transmission. This protocol allows for low-power, long-range communication between the device and the network's infrastructure. LoRaWAN operates in the ISM frequency bands, which vary by region (e.g., 868 MHz in Europe, 915 MHz in the Americas). It provides advantages such as minimal power consumption and enhanced range, making it ideal for both urban and remote installations.

### Power Consumption

ROBEAU has been optimized for low power consumption, making it suitable for long-term deployments. The device can be powered by batteries, ensuring several years of operation depending on the frequency of data transmission. A typical setup with standard data reporting intervals can be expected to last for about 5 years on a single set of batteries. Users can also opt for solar power configurations in outdoor environments, which can provide a sustainable power supply.

### Use Cases

1. **Residential Water Monitoring**: Homeowners can use ROBEAU to track water usage, thus facilitating water conservation.
2. **Commercial Buildings**: Businesses can manage water use to reduce costs and promote sustainability.
3. **Agriculture**: Farmers can optimize irrigation schedules by monitoring water usage and preventing waste.
4. **Municipal Applications**: Cities can integrate ROBEAU into water supply networks to detect leaks and monitor consumption at a large scale.

### Limitations

- **Pipe Compatibility**: The device may not work with all pipe sizes and materials; proper fitting is essential for accurate readings.
- **Signal Interference**: In dense urban environments or areas with significant obstacles, the LoRaWAN signal may experience interference, requiring optimal placement of gateways.
- **Battery Life**: Although designed for long battery life, the frequency of data reporting can significantly affect power consumption.
- **Data Latency**: Due to LoRaWAN's design for infrequent data transmission, real-time monitoring may have a slight lag depending on the configuration.
- **Initial Costs**: While beneficial, the initial installation and setup can be costly for some users, particularly when integrating with existing systems.

In summary, ROBEAU offers a comprehensive solution for water monitoring and management, leveraging advanced sensing technologies and IoT communication protocols to facilitate sustainable and efficient water use.
