***KRON - Ks 3000 (KRON) Technical Overview***

**Working Principles**

The KRON - Ks 3000 operates on the basis of IoT-based sensor technology. It utilizes an integrated sensor array to record and transmit data, including temperature, humidity, and pressure. These parameters are processed by an onboard microcontroller and the corresponding values are sent to a centralized server or IoT dashboard via LoRaWAN technology. 

**Installation Guide**

The KRON - Ks 3000 is designed for easy installation:

1. First, locate an ideal point for deployment considering factors such as range of the LoRaWAN network and clear access to measurement parameters. 

2. Mount the device using provided screws or adhesive tape. Ensure that the device is secure and in the required orientation. 

3. Install batteries in the device.

4. Turn on the device by toggling the provided switch. 

5. Using a LoRaWAN network server, register the device by adding its DevEUI, AppEUI and AppKey.

6. Proceed to commission the device on the server and assign it to the appropriate application.

**LoRaWAN Details**

LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) is a protocol designed for wireless battery-operated devices in a regional, national or global network. The KRON - Ks 3000 uses LoRaWAN due to its long range and low power characteristics. It operates in the ISM band, typically at 868MHz in Europe and 915MHz in North America. The maximum transmission power of the Kron - Ks 3000 is set at 14dBm. FCC approval is required for US usage, while ETSI governs the European usage. 

**Power Consumption**

The KRON - Ks 3000 is highly efficient in power consumption. It is designed to operate on a pair of AA batteries for approximately 5 years, assuming a data transmission interval of 10 minutes. However, the power consumption can vary with frequency of sensor data reads and the amount of data transmitted.

**Use Cases**

The KRON - Ks 3000 can be utilized in numerous scenarios, including:

- Climate control and environmental monitoring in warehouses and greenhouses.
- Industrial process monitoring, where temperature, humidity, or pressure are crucial parameters.
- Monitoring cold chains to ensure consistent environmental conditions for perishable items.
- Home automation systems, for intelligent climate control.

**Limitations**

While the KRON - Ks 3000 provides several advantages, there are several limitations to note. The communication range may be obstructed or shortened by physical obstacles or electromagnetic interference. Its operation relies heavily on the LoRaWAN network â€“ without it, the device cannot transmit data. Moreover, while the device can operate in a wide range of environmental conditions, it is not completely waterproof and could be damaged by liquid ingression. Lastly, the device does not support other protocol standards like Zigbee or NB-IoT, which could limit its usage in environments where these protocols are in use.
