**Technical Overview for NETVOX - R718Wb**

The NETVOX R718Wb is a wireless sensor device designed to monitor water leakages. Leveraging the LoRaWAN protocol, it provides reliable long-range communication, making it suitable for various environments where early detection of water presence is crucial.

**Working Principles:**

The R718Wb operates through a water leak sensor connected to the main device unit via a cable. The primary function is to detect the presence of water at the sensor probe location. When water contacts the probe, the sensor's circuit closes, triggering the device to send an alert via the LoRaWAN network. This real-time monitoring is essential in preventing water-related damages in sensitive areas.

**Installation Guide:**

1. **Choosing the Location:**
   - Install the probe in areas prone to leakage such as under sinks, near water heaters, or basement areas.
   - Ensure the environment is within the operating temperature range and avoids direct exposure to extreme conditions or elements.

2. **Mounting the Device:**
   - Secure the main unit on a wall or other stable surfaces using suitable screws.
   - Position the probe flat on the surface where water detection is required.

3. **Connecting the Probe:**
   - Connect the water leak probe to the device, ensuring the connection is firm for stable operation.

4. **Activation and Configuration:**
   - Insert batteries and power on the device.
   - Ensure the device is properly configured via a LoRaWAN network server, entering the necessary parameters such as DevEUI, AppEUI, and AppKey for network joining.

5. **Testing the Setup:**
   - Simulate a water leak to confirm the sensor detects presence accurately and sends a corresponding alert.

**LoRaWAN Details:**

- **Frequency Range:** Depending on regional regulations and operator agreements; commonly uses frequencies in the ISM band.
- **Communication Range:** Can achieve several kilometers in range, optimal in open or rural environments.
- **Network Infrastructure:** Requires a LoRaWAN gateway and network server for managing data and devices.
- **Data Transmission:** Sends periodic status updates and alerts when water is detected, minimizing communication to conserve energy.

**Power Consumption:**

- Utilizes a replaceable battery (type: CR123A) for power.
- Extremely low power consumption due to the LoRaWAN communication, with possible battery life spanning several years under normal operating conditions.
- Battery life is heavily influenced by the frequency of events and data transmission intervals.

**Use Cases:**

- **Residential Buildings:** Early detection of leaks before they cause significant damage.
- **Commercial Properties:** Monitor water leakages in offices, hotels, and facility management.
- **Industrial Environments:** Protect equipment in manufacturing plants where water exposure is detrimental.
- **Data Centers:** Safeguard sensitive equipment from water damage ensuring uninterrupted operations.
- **Healthcare Facilities:** Monitor plumbing and medical equipment areas for water-related hazards.

**Limitations:**

- **Detection Area:** Limited to the specific area around the probe, requiring multiple sensors for extensive coverage.
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Dependent on network latency and device duty cycle settings; may not provide instant alerts in all scenarios.
- **Environmental Restrictions:** Ensures optimum performance within specified temperature and humidity ranges.
- **Battery Dependency:** Long-term maintenance includes periodic battery replacement for continuous operation.
- **LoRaWAN Coverage Necessary:** Requires adequate LoRaWAN network coverage and infrastructure for proper functionality.

Overall, the NETVOX R718Wb is a powerful tool for preventing water damage through efficient and reliable leakage detection, scalable through its integration capabilities with existing IoT frameworks.
