##  GLOBALSAT - Lt 100Hpep Technical Overview

### 1. Working Principles

The GLOBALSAT - Lt 100Hpep, also known as GLOBALSAT, operates on the principle of LoRa technology. LoRa, or "Long Range", is a wireless communication method designed specifically for long-range communications using low power. The sensor uses LoRa's spread spectrum modulation, which maintains communication without substantial power output, even over very long ranges.

The device connects to a LoRaWAN network, a media access control (MAC) layer protocol for managing communication between LPWAN gateways and end-node devices, as part of the LoRa Alliance's LoRaWAN open standard. It gives freedom of communication, ensuring no data is lost in transmission.

### 2. Installation Guide

To install the GLOBALSAT - Lt 100Hpep:

- Identify the installation location; desired areas should have clear view of the sky for optimal GPS reception.
- Mount the GLOBALSAT – Lt 100Hpep using the provided mounting options.
- Connect the sensor to a LoRa gateway.
- Power the device using the provided power source.
- Install the LoRaWAN network server software, and direct the GLOBALSAT - Lt 100Hpep to connect to the server.
  
### 3. LoRaWAN Details

This sensor device uses the LoRaWAN protocol, a Low Power, Wide Area (LPWA) networking protocol designed to wirelessly connect 'things' to the Internet in regional, national or global networks. It targets key requirements of the internet of things such as secure bi-directional communication, mobility, and localization services.

### 4. Power Consumption

The power consumption of GLOBALSAT - Lt 100Hpep is extremely low, considering its capabilities. Since it’s a LoRa enabled device, it has a low battery consumption and can last on its original power source for an extended period, eventually decreasing the total cost of ownership.

### 5. Use Cases

The GLOBALSAT - Lt 100Hpep has a wide range of applications, including:

- Asset Tracking: Track the location and movements of valuable assets over a wide area.
- Smart Agriculture: Monitor and control agricultural activities over large farm fields. 
- Industrial Automation: Monitor and control industrial machinery over a long distance.
- Smart City Applications: Monitor city assets and environments over a wide city-scale network.

### 6. Limitations

- The GLOBALSAT – Lt 100Hpep requires a LoRaWAN gateway within range to function. If no gateways are within range, the device will be unable to connect and transmit data.
- It operates under the assumption of a clear line of sight to the sky for optimal GPS reception. In enclosures or under certain weather conditions, GPS signal may be lost.
- While its battery life is impressive, once the battery degrades past a certain point, it must be replaced.
