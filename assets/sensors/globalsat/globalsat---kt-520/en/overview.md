## GLOBALSAT - Kt 520 Technical Overview

### Working Principles

The GLOBALSAT - KT 520 is a versatile IoT device which avails the benefits of the LoRa (Long Range) technology for communication needs. The sensor operates by recording and transmitting precise data it collects within its range. Information gleaned from the sensor could be temperature, humidity, or other relevant data depending on the intended use case. The sensor then communicates this collected data back to the receiving base via a LoRaWAN network, where it can be analyzed and exploited for various operational needs. The advantage of LoRaWAN lies in its long-range connectivity, allowing for device operation in hard-to-reach or remote areas.

### Installation Guide

1. Identify the position for deployment - Choose a strategic location to install the sensor depending on the data to be collected.
2. Set up the sensor - Mount the GLOBALSAT - KT 520 sensor on the identified position.
3. Configure your device - Using a dedicated application, configure the sensor's settings to fit its role.
5. Register the device on the network - Using its unique id, register the device on the LoRaWAN network.
6. Test the Installation - Conclude the process by making sure the device transmits data correctly to the intended servers.

### LoRaWAN Details

The GLOBALSAT - KT 520 utilizes the LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) communication module. This wireless protocol allows for low-power communication from the sensor to the LoRaWAN gateways located several kilometers away, depending on the level of obstruction. LoRaWAN operates in different frequency bands allocated for ISM (Industrial, Scientific, and Medical) use, which varies by region.

### Power Consumption

The KT-520 is designed for low power consumption. It is engineered to ensure a long battery life, which is essential considering the use of its LoRaWAN network for long-range communication. The exact power consumption will depend on the frequency of the collected data transmissions and the payload size.

### Use Cases

There are various uses for the GLOBALSAT - KT 520 due to its versatile nature. Some examples include:

1. Supply chain monitoring - Temperature and humidity tracking.
2. Building automation - Monitoring indoor living conditions.
3. Environmental monitoring - It can be used to collect data on various weather conditions.
4. Agriculture - Useful for soil conditions tracking.

### Limitations

As with any device, the GLOBALSAT - KT 520 has certain limitations. One key limitation is the dependency on local regulations on frequency usage for ISM bands, consequently affecting its range. While the KT 520 is designed for long-range communication, any physical obstruction in its not direct line of sight to the gateway, reduce the overall range. The KT-520 is also limited by the amount of data it can send due to the duty cycle limitations imposed by the LoRaWAN network to optimize bandwidth use and prevent congestion.
