## Technical Overview: GlobalSat LS-111P 

### Working Principles
The GlobalSat LS-111P is an innovative LoRaWAN PIR (Passive Infrared) sensor designed to detect and convey movement and temperature changes within an environment. The device works on the principle of sensing infrared energy changes, which are typically caused by humans or animals moving across the sensor field. The LS-111P also houses a temperature sensor to collect ambient temperature data. The collected data is transmitted over a LoRaWAN network to a gateway, providing real-time movement and temperature changes.

### Installation Guide

To install the GlobalSat LS-111P sensor, follow the steps below:

1. Fix the bracket to the installation site using screws.

2. Attach the sensor to the bracket.

3. Set the desired orientation of the sensor.

NOTE: It should be installed at a height of 2.2m above the ground without cover to ensure optimal detection.

Insert 2 x AAA batteries into the battery compartment complying with proper polarity. Note that the sensor should be installed in an indoor environment. 

### LoRaWAN Details

The LS-111P employs LoRaWAN technology, operating in the EU868, US915, AS923, AU915, KR920, IN865 frequency bands. It supports adaptive data rates (ADR) and different classes (A, C) based on the LoRaWAN protocol specification v1.0.2. 

### Power Consumption 

The LS-111P is energy-efficient with an ultra-low power consumption mechanism designed for long-term use. It operates on 2 x AAA batteries, which under normal use, can provide operational functionality for up to five years. However, power consumption might vary based on the amount of transmitted data and on environmental factors.

### Use Cases

The LS-111P is particularly useful in environments requiring movement surveillance and temperature monitoring. The use-cases can range from home security, office space monitoring, warehouse surveillance, hotel room management to elderly care facilities. The PIR sensor can provide movement notifications while the temperature sensor can monitor for unusual heat changes signifying a potential fire. 

### Limitations

While the LS-111P is a versatile device, there are a few limitations:

- The device is meant for indoor use only. Using it outdoors may damage the device and reduce operational longevity.

- The PIR sensor's reliability can be influenced by environmental factors such as extremely high or low temperatures and the presence of obstacles in the field view.

- The sensor should not be installed near strong electromagnetic sources as it may interfere with the sensor's functionality.

- Distance coverage is subject to LoRaWAN network availability. Signal strength and data transmission reliability may decline due to the absence or poor quality of a LoRaWAN network in the area of installation. 

- The device is not equipped for real-time continuous tracking but is designed for sporadic monitoring.
