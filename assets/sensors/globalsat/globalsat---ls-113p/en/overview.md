**Technical Overview - GLOBALSAT – LS 113P (GLOBALSAT)**

GLOBALSAT - LS 113P is an intelligent and versatile IoT sensor utilizing the LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) technology. This sensor is designed for monitoring the remote environment through measuring parameters like temperature, humidity, and illumination.

**Working Principle:**

The LS 113P sensor employs the LoRaWAN wireless protocol that allows it to transmit information over long distances while consuming very little power. Upon installation, the sensor starts collecting data from its environment. The sensor functions by measuring changes in its surrounding environment.

An integrated microcontroller processes these physical changes into a digital format, which is further transmitted through the LoRaWAN network. The sensor data is then sent to the respective server for further analysis and tracking. 

**Installation Guide:**

To install the LS 113P sensor, ensure you are in a dust-free, dry environment. Fix the sensor in the desired position and switch it on. Before installation, ensure that you have configured your LoRaWAN gateway and that it is within the range of the sensor. Once switched on, the sensor will start collecting data and transmit it over the LoRaWAN protocol to your network server.

**LoRaWAN Details:**

The LS 113P sensor uses the LoRaWAN protocol stack which is optimized for low power consumption and supports large networks with millions of devices. It operates in different frequency bands which are predefined by the LoRa Alliance, including 868 MHz (Europe), 915 MHz (North America), and others.

**Power Consumption:**

The LS 113P is designed for high efficiency and low power consumption, which makes it ideal for long-term, unattended deployments. It operates on a 3.6V/2900 mAh battery and features a deep sleep mode for conserving energy when not transmitting data.

**Use Cases:**

The LS 113P is suitable for a range of applications, including:

1. **Smart Agriculture**: Monitoring environmental parameters in real-time to optimize crop growth conditions.
2. **Smart Buildings**: It can be used to monitor and control indoor climate, thus improving occupants' comfort while also saving energy.
3. **Industrial Applications**: The sensor can be used in industries to monitor environmental conditions and detect potential issues before they escalate.

**Limitations:**

Although the LS 113P offers numerous benefits, some limitations should be acknowledged:

1. **Dependence on LoRaWAN Network**: The sensor relies heavily on the availability of the LoRaWAN network for data transmission. If the network fails, data transmission is interrupted.
2. **Limited Data Rate**: Due to LoRaWAN’s focus on long-range and low power consumption, the data rates are relatively low, which limits real-time high data-intensive applications.
3. **Environmental Limits**: While suitable for various environments, the sensor's operation may be affected by extreme temperatures or high humidity levels, which can affect the accuracy of the readings.
4. **Battery-dependent**: Without a constant power supply, the batteries should be replaced regularly to ensure optimal function.
5. **Installation location**: Since it relies on wireless technology, the location and distance from the gateway can affect the effectiveness of the data transmissions. Signal blockages may cause loss of data.

Overall, the GLOBALSAT - LS 113P offers a versatile, high-efficiency solution for various IoT applications, with its unique combination of features and functionalities.
