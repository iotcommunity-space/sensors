## Technical Overview of GLOBALSAT - ST 100

The GLOBALSAT - ST 100 is a versatile and robust IoT sensor designed to monitor and transmit data over LoRaWAN networks. Its key features include ease of installation, low power consumption, and compatibility with industrial applications, making it ideal for remote monitoring in various environments.

### Working Principles

The GLOBALSAT - ST 100 utilizes sensors to collect environmental and operational data. These sensors can detect parameters such as temperature, humidity, or other specific monitoring needs depending on the model. Once the data is collected, it uses LoRaWAN technology to transmit this data to a central server where it can be analyzed and acted upon in real time. LoRaWAN is a low-power, wide-area networking protocol designed to wirelessly connect battery-operated devices to the internet over long range.

### Installation Guide

1. **Site Assessment**: Identify suitable locations for the sensor that will ensure optimal data collection and transmission. Ensure the location is within range of a LoRaWAN gateway.
   
2. **Mounting**: Securely attach the GLOBALSAT - ST 100 using the provided mounting kit. This can typically involve screws, brackets, or adhesive setups as required by the environment.

3. **Activation**: Power on the device by either inserting batteries or connecting to an external power source. The unit might come partially charged, but full initial charging is recommended.

4. **Configuration**: Use the provided software tools or mobile application to configure the device. This includes setting transmission intervals, thresholds for alerts, and other sensor-specific settings.

5. **Network Connection**: Ensure the device is correctly connected to a LoRaWAN network. This may involve joining a local network or setting up a private one, depending on deployment needs.

6. **Testing**: Conduct initial testing by simulating conditions and ensuring that data is being transmitted and received accurately on the server or dashboard.

### LoRaWAN Details

- **Frequency**: Supports standard LoRaWAN frequency bands suitable for use in various regions (e.g., EU868, US915).
  
- **Data Rate**: Offers adjustable data rates to balance between range and data payload size.
  
- **Network Join Procedure**: Supports both Over the Air Activation (OTAA) and Activation by Personalization (ABP).

- **Security**: Implements encryption as per LoRaWAN standards for secure data transmission.

### Power Consumption

The GLOBALSAT - ST 100 is designed for low power consumption, making it suitable for remote installations where frequent maintenance is impractical. It typically operates on AA or lithium-ion batteries and can last several years depending on data transmission frequency and environmental conditions.

- **Sleep Mode**: Consumes minimal energy during sleep, awakening at set intervals to transmit data.

- **Dynamic Power Management**: Adjusts power usage based on operating conditions and network requirements.

### Use Cases

- **Environmental Monitoring**: Effective in measuring temperature and humidity in greenhouses, agricultural fields, and forests.
  
- **Industrial Applications**: Used for monitoring parameters in remote industrial sites, such as oil fields or manufacturing plants.
  
- **Smart Cities**: Can be employed for monitoring environmental conditions or infrastructure health in urban settings.

- **Logistics**: Useful in vehicle or warehouse monitoring to track climate conditions affecting stored goods.

### Limitations

- **Network Dependence**: The sensor relies on access to a LoRaWAN network for data transmission, which can be limiting in areas with poor coverage.

- **Data Transmission Delays**: Due to its low-power design, data is not transmitted in real time but rather at configured intervals, which may not be suitable for all applications.

- **Limited Sensor Range**: While excellent for certain measurements, it may not support every type of sensor measurement directly, depending on the model variant.

- **Environmental Constraints**: Must be protected from extreme weather or other environmental factors if not encased in a suitable enclosure.

The GLOBALSAT - ST 100 is a comprehensive and reliable sensor for industries seeking to leverage IoT for improved monitoring and data-driven insights, yet like any tool, requires careful consideration of its deployment environment and application to optimize its utility.
