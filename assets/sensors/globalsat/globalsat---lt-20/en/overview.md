### GLOBALSAT - Lt 20 Documentation Overview

#### Working Principles
The GLOBALSAT Lt 20 is a cutting-edge LoRaWAN IoT module, designed for integration into devices that require long-range data transmission. The Lt 20 operates by using LoRa spread-spectrum technology, which provides extended communication range while maintaining low power consumption. The module combines a low power-enabled microcontroller system (MCU) with a LoRa RF transceiver, enabling bi-directional communication with high sensitivity.

#### Installation Guide 
Firstly, ensure your device is compatible with GLOBALSAT Lt 20. Carefully attach the module to your device's mainboard, ensure it's correctly seated and secure. The module communicates via UART, an industry-standard interface, which allows analog and digital IOs. As such, physical installation requires very few adjustments. For software configuration, the GLOBALSAT Lt 20 follows the AT command set where each command allows default configurations to setup application-specific behaviors such as operation modes, data rates, and frequencies.

#### LoRaWAN Details
LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) is a low power, wide area networking protocol designed for wireless battery-operated devices. The GLOBALSAT Lt 20 supports LoRaWAN Class A and C, both of which provide bidirectional communications. Lt 20 can also operate in standalone (LoRa) mode, suitable for P2P applications. 

#### Power Consumption
The GLOBALSAT Lt 20 features extremely efficient power management. In sleeping mode, it has an impressively low power consumption of only 1.6Î¼A, while power consumption in transmitting mode goes up to 120mA maximum. These features provide longevity to the battery life of devices it is fitted on.

#### Use Cases
The GLOBALSAT Lt 20 represents a wide range of use cases including but not limited to remote agriculture, environmental monitoring, smart cities, utility metering, and home automation. Any application that requires wireless communication over a long range with minimal power usage will benefit from the features the Lt 20 has to offer.

#### Limitations
Despite its strengths, the GLOBALSAT Lt 20 has a couple of limitations. These include:

1. Data Rate: Due to the long-range, low-power nature of LoRa, data rates are kept low - from 0.3 kbps to 50 kbps. This makes it unsuitable for applications requiring high data transfer.

2. Network Density: LoRaWAN is not designed to handle high network densities. In scenarios where many devices are transmitting simultaneously, packet collision can be a limitation.

3. Depth of Signal Penetration: Though LoRa technology provides extensive coverage, it has limitations in heavily built-up areas and underground where signal penetration can be weak.

Understanding these limitations is beneficial in assessing the suitability of the Lt 20 IoT module for specific applications.
