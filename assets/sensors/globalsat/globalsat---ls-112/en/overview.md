**Technical Overview of GLOBALSAT - LS 112**

**Working Principles:**

The GLOBALSAT LS-112 is a temperature and humidity sensor which operates using a LoRaWAN interface. It uses a cutting-edge LoRaWAN communication protocol to transmit temperature and humidity data to the dedicated server. 

It employs a thermistor sensor with a high level of sensitivity to accurately measure both ambient temperature and relative humidity. In addition, the low power consumption of the sensor allows it to have a long battery lifespan, making it perfect for IoT applications.

**Installation Guide:**

Installation of the GLOBALSAT LS-112 sensor is straightforward and user-friendly.

1. Mount the device in the location of your choice. Avoid locations near heat sources or locations with high humidity concentrations that could tamper with the readings.
2. Connext the device to the LoRaWAN network.
3. Configure the device settings through the network server (such as data reporting intervals and LoRa transmission power).
4. To get the data, access the server that the device is connected to.

**LoRaWAN Details:**

LS-112 uses a LoRaWAN Class A standard protocol. It communicates with the gateway in a bidirectional mode perfect for real-time monitoring applications. Moreover, it employs an adaptive data rate (ADR) mechanism, to optimize energy consumption and minimize communication interference.

**Power Consumption:**

The LS-112 is designed for low power consumption. Its operation relies on a ½ AA Lithium battery, and the level of power consumption will significantly depend on the data transmission frequency. 

**Use Cases:**

Globalsat LS-112 is effectively used across multiple sectors:

- Smart Buildings: It is used to monitor indoor climatic conditions for optimal comfort and energy efficiency.
- Agriculture: The LS-112 is beneficial in smart farming, allowing farmers to monitor and control temperature and humidity in greenhouses.
- Logistics and Supply Chain: It can be used to monitor temperature and humidity in sensitive goods transportation, e.g., food, pharmaceuticals.

**Limitations:**

Despite its many benefits, the GS-112 does have a few limitations:

- It relies on a LoRaWAN network; without this network's coverage, the sensor cannot transmit data.
- The device comes with a non-rechargeable battery, so once the battery is depleted, it will need replacement.
- It operates within a temperature range of -20 to +55°C and relative humidity range of 0 to 100% RH. Conditions beyond these may compromise the sensor's accuracy.
- While it furnishes accurate temperature and humidity data, it does not provide carbon dioxide or particulate matter data, which might be necessary for specific applications.
