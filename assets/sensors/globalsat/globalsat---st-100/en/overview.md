## GLOBALSAT – St 100 Technical Overview 

### Working Principles 

The GLOBALSAT - St 100 serves as a LoRaWAN-Based IoT sensor, designed to collect and transmit location, humidity, temperature, and motion functionality data. 

The St 100 employs advanced line sensor technologies to detect and generate critical data based on the set parameters. This device works on the principle of interrupt-driven programming where sensor activities interrupt the main routine to deliver specific sensor readings. 

### Installation Guide
1. Unbox the GLOBALSAT - St 100 device and ensure all components are accounted for.
2. Download and install the required software on your device. 
3. Turn on the St 100. Its LED indicator should blink, indicating the initialization process.
4. Via the software, set your preferred parameters for temperature, humidity, motion and location.
5. Position the St 100 in its desired location. Ensure the area is compatible with the sensor’s operating conditions.
6. Connect the St 100 to the LoRa Network by setting the correct frequency and network keys on the software.

Remember always to confirm software updates for the GLOBALSAT - St 100 to maintain optimal efficiency.

### LoRaWAN Details
The GLOBALSAT - St 100 utilizes Low Power Wide Area Network(LPWAN) protocol technology- LoRaWAN. It offers features like low power consumption and long-range transmission. LoRaWAN protocol supports bi-directional communication, end-to-end security, mobility, and localization services. 

### Power Consumption
The GLOBALSAT - St 100 operates with energy efficiency in mind. It uses a small power consumption MCU and smart sleep mode to reduce energy use. Power consumption also depends on the frequency of data transmission and the payload of data transmitted. The battery life is estimated to last several years, depending on the operational settings and environment.

### Use Cases
The St 100 finds a home in various applications given its robust features. These include:

1. **Supply Chain Management**: Tracking the conditions of goods in transit.
2. **Smart Agriculture**: Monitoring temperature and humidity in farms and greenhouses.
3. **Smart Cities**: Surveillance and safety applications, tracking environmental conditions. 
4. **Industrial IoT**: Monitors equipment for preventive maintenance.
5. **Home and Building Automation**: Sensors monitor safety and comfort conditions inside buildings.

### Limitations 
While the St 100 shines in efficiency and versatility, some limitations are worth noting.

1. **Distance from Gateway**: The required communication distance can be a limitation. The further the device is from the gateway, the higher the chances of having weak signals.
2. **Battery**: Being a low-power device designed for long-term use, battery replacement may be a complex process that might need technical guidance.
3. **Interference**: Like all wireless devices, the St 100 operates on radio frequencies that can be prone to interference from other sources.
4. **Physical Obstruction**: Structures such as buildings and walls can affect the signal strength. 

Always perform a feasibility study to ensure your environment aligns with the capabilities of the GLOBALSAT - St 100.
