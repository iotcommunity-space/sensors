## Technical Overview for NETVOX - R311W

### Introduction
The NETVOX R311W is a wireless water leak sensor designed for IoT applications, leveraging the LoRaWAN communication protocol. It's an ideal solution for remote monitoring of potential water leaks in various environments, ensuring timely corrective actions to prevent damage.

### Working Principles
The R311W sensor detects the presence of water using its highly sensitive probe. When water is detected, the sensor sends an alert to a connected LoRaWAN network. The detection mechanism is based on the change in electrical resistance across two conductive traces on the probe. When water bridges these traces, the resistance drops, triggering the sensor alert.

### Installation Guide
1. **Unboxing and Inspection**: Carefully unbox the R311W and verify all components are present and undamaged.
2. **Probe Placement**: Identify areas prone to water leakage, such as near pipes, under sinks, or in basements. Place the probe in these locations ensuring good contact with the surface.
3. **Mounting**: Secure the main sensor unit using screws or adhesive tape provided, keeping it out of direct contact with potential water sources.
4. **Configuration**: Access the internal configuration button to set network parameters. Consult the user manual for instructions on joining your LoRaWAN network.
5. **Testing**: Simulate a water leak by wetting the probe slightly to confirm it triggers a detection alert.

### LoRaWAN Details
- **Frequency Bands**: Operates in various frequencies depending on regional regulations, including EU868, US915, and AS923.
- **Communication Range**: Up to 10 kilometers in rural areas and around 3 kilometers in urban environments.
- **Data Transmission**: Utilizes Class A LoRaWAN devices, providing asynchronous uplink transmission based on the sensor's configuration.
- **Network Security**: Ensures secure communication with AES-128 encryption over the LoRaWAN network.

### Power Consumption
- **Power Source**: Utilizes a standard 3.0V CR2450 lithium coin cell battery.
- **Battery Life**: Approximate battery life is up to 5 years, contingent on the frequency of detections and configuration settings (e.g., data uplink interval).
- **Power Efficiency**: Designed to enter a low-power sleep mode when not transmitting, conserving battery life.

### Use Cases
- **Residential**: Early detection of leaks under sinks, in basements, or near appliances like washing machines.
- **Commercial**: Monitor restrooms, kitchens, and boiler rooms in offices, schools, and hospitals.
- **Industrial**: Water leakage detection in chemical plants, server rooms, and other critical infrastructure facilities.
- **Agricultural**: Oversee irrigation systems and water storage tanks to prevent resource wastage.

### Limitations
- **Environmental Conditions**: Designed for indoor use with operating temperatures ranging from -20°C to 55°C. Prolonged exposure to extreme conditions may affect performance.
- **Network Coverage**: Effectiveness is contingent on LoRaWAN network availability and coverage. In areas with poor coverage, the communication range may be significantly reduced.
- **Placement**: Accurate detection requires strategic probe placement; improper installation could lead to false negatives.
- **Battery Life**: Battery lifespan is subject to operational conditions, including the ambient temperature and the frequency of water leak incidents requiring reporting.

In conclusion, the NETVOX R311W offers robust and reliable water leakage detection capabilities suitable across multiple applications. Its integration into a LoRaWAN network ensures long-range, low-power communication, making it a valuable component in smart building management and environmental monitoring.
