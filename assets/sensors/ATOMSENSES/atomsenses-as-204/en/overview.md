### Technical Overview: ATOMSENSES - AS 204

**Introduction**
The ATOMSENSES - AS 204 is an advanced IoT sensor designed for remote environmental monitoring applications. Utilizing LoRaWAN technology, it offers long-range wireless communication capabilities, making it ideal for rural and industrial settings. This sensor is engineered to measure temperature, humidity, and barometric pressure with high precision.

#### Working Principles
The AS 204 sensors use microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) to accurately capture environmental data. The temperature is measured using a thermistor, humidity via capacitive measurement, and barometric pressure using a piezoresistive diaphragm. These components convert physical parameters into electrical signals, processed by an onboard microcontroller. The processed data is then transmitted through the LoRaWAN network for remote monitoring and analytics.

#### Installation Guide

1. **Site Selection:**
   - Choose a location that is representative of the environment you want to monitor.
   - Ensure there is adequate line-of-sight to a LoRaWAN gateway, free from tall structures or dense foliage.

2. **Mounting:**
   - Secure the sensor unit at the desired height using mounting brackets.
   - Position the sensors in a manner that avoids direct exposure to sunlight and rain to prevent skewed readings and potential damage.

3. **Power Configuration:**
   - Insert the provided lithium battery into the designated compartment.
   - Ensure the compartment is sealed to maintain IP67-rated protection against dust and water ingress.

4. **Network Configuration:**
   - Using the ATOMSENSES companion app, input the unique device EUI to register the device on the LoRaWAN network.
   - Configure the data transmission interval based on your monitoring needs and battery life considerations.

5. **Calibration:**
   - Perform a system check via the app to ensure readings are within expected ranges.
   - If necessary, adjust calibration settings through the app interface for precise measurement alignment.
