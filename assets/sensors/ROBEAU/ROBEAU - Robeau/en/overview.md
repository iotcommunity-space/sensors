## Technical Overview for ROBEAU - Robeau (ROBEAU)

### Working Principles

ROBEAU is an advanced IoT sensor designed for real-time water consumption monitoring. It is engineered to provide accurate flow data to help facilities manage water usage efficiently, identify leaks, and optimize resource consumption. The device operates by using ultrasonic or electromagnetic principles to detect water flow within a pipeline. These principles ensure high precision and minimal contact with the water, providing a non-intrusive measurement method.

1. **Ultrasonic Measurement**: ROBEAU utilizes ultrasonic waves to measure transit time between sensors mounted on the pipe exterior. Changes in this transit time are directly related to the speed and volume of water flowing through the pipe.
   
2. **Electromagnetic Measurement**: The sensor can also use electromagnetic fields to induce a voltage across the water flow. This voltage, which varies according to the flow velocity, is then converted into a measurable flow rate.

### Installation Guide

1. **Pre-Installation Requirements**:
    - Ensure that the pipe size and material are compatible with the ROBEAU sensor model.
    - Verify the availability of LoRaWAN network coverage in the installation area.
    - Prepare the necessary mounting brackets and tools required for installation.

2. **Steps for Installation**:
    - **Mounting the Sensor**: Secure the ROBEAU sensor to the exterior of the pipe using the provided brackets. Ensure the sensor is aligned correctly according to the flow direction indicated on the device.
    - **Electrical Connections**: If required, connect the sensor to the power supply using the provided cables. Verify that the power connections are insulated and secure.
    - **Connecting to LoRaWAN**: Activate the device by logging into the ROBEAU configuration panel and registering it on the LoRaWAN network. Use the device's unique identification code for network registration.
    - **Calibration**: Follow the on-screen instructions in the configuration panel to calibrate the sensor. This may include setting zero flow conditions and verifying reading accuracy.

### LoRaWAN Details

ROBEAU supports LoRaWAN, enabling it to transmit data over long distances using minimal power. It utilizes the following LoRaWAN specifications:

- **Frequency Bands**: The sensor operates on sub-GHz ISM bands (e.g., 868 MHz in Europe, 915 MHz in the United States).
- **Data Rate**: ROBEAU can adapt between multiple spreading factors, optimizing data transmission for distance and reliability through ADR (Adaptive Data Rate).
- **Payload**: Data packets include water flow readings, device status, and battery level.
- **Security**: Employs AES-128 encryption to ensure data protection and privacy.

### Power Consumption

ROBEAU is designed to be power-efficient, suitable for applications where battery longevity is crucial. The sensor's power consumption profiles are as follows:

- **Active Mode**: Up to 30 mA during data transmission.
- **Sleep Mode**: Less than 1 mA, extending battery life significantly.
- **Battery Life**: In standard operating conditions, the battery can last up to 5 years, depending on transmission frequency and environmental conditions.

### Use Cases

ROBEAU is ideal for a variety of applications:

- **Commercial Buildings**: Monitor water usage to improve efficiency and detect leaks quickly.
- **Industrial Facilities**: Optimize water use in processes, comply with environmental regulations, and reduce operational costs.
- **Agriculture**: Manage irrigation systems effectively, ensuring optimal water distribution and usage.
- **Smart Cities**: Enable municipal water management systems to enhance oversight and sustainability.

### Limitations

- **Network Dependency**: The performance is contingent upon LoRaWAN network coverage and availability, which might not be robust in remote locations.
- **Interference**: Although designed to minimize false readings, electromagnetic or ultrasonic sensors can be susceptible to external electromagnetic interference in some industrial settings.
- **Pipe Conditions**: Accuracy can be affected by pipe material, diameter variations, or installation on non-standard pipe configurations.
- **Environment**: Extremely harsh environments may impact the deviceâ€™s casing and battery life.

In conclusion, ROBEAU offers a comprehensive solution for real-time water monitoring across diverse sectors. Its integration within IoT frameworks enables proactive water management, yet it requires careful consideration regarding installation environments and network capabilities to fully leverage its potential.
