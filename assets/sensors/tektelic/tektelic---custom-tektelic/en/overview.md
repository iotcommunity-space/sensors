**Technical Overview of TEKTELIC Custom Sensor**

**Working Principles**

TEKTELICâ€™s custom sensor leverages Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to collect, transmit and process valuable data, providing users with critical insights and controls. Utilizing low-energy sensors to capture environmental and other variables, the collected data is transmitted over LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network), a power-efficient, long-range, and scalable network structure. This data can then be processed and utilized for deploying smart, responsive actions.

**Installation Guide**

1. Set up the central LoRaWAN Gateway that the TEKTELIC sensors will communicate with.
2. Use either a compact handheld device or a specially designed tool to install the sensor in the chosen location. 
3. Once installed, configure your sensor via the user interface to connect to the LoRa network.
4. Run a test to ensure successful sensor registration over the network.
5. Finalize the installation by setting up the desired detection functions.

**LoRaWAN Details**

The TEKTELIC custom sensor uses LoRaWAN communication, a media access control (MAC) layer protocol for managing communication between LPWAN gateways and end-node devices. Its advantages include long-range connectivity, lasting several kilometers, minimal power consumption, and the capacity to manage numerous connected devices. It operates in various frequencies depending on the region of operation.

**Power Consumption**

Designed for energy efficiency, TEKTELIC sensors have a low power consumption rate, making them fit for long-term, uninterrupted operation. Sampling rates, transmit power, and data rates can be adjusted to match the usage scenario, further extending the battery life depending on the specific requirements.

**Use Cases**

TEKTELIC sensors can be applied in many sectors, including:

1. Agriculture: Soil moisture and climate conditions monitoring to optimize crop yield.
2. Industrial: Detecting machinery malfunctions or maintenance needs.
3. Environmental: Monitoring air quality, temperature, and humidity.
4. Infrastructure: Structural health monitoring of buildings, bridges, tunnels, etc.

**Limitations**

Although the TEKTELIC sensor provides significant advantages, it does possess certain limitations:

1. LoRaWAN Coverage: Dependence on network coverage means operation might be limited in areas with poor or no LoRaWAN signal.
2. Operational Conditions: Extreme environmental conditions could impact sensor readings and overall longevity.
3. Physical Obstructions: The sensor's data transmission range might be curtailed by physical obstructions such as walls, buildings, or dense foliage.
4. Battery Life: Although optimized for power efficiency, long-term usage may require battery replacement or recharging.

By understanding the comprehensive function, proper installation, operation and potential limitations of TEKTELIC sensors, users can maximize the advantages provided by this versatile IoT technology.
