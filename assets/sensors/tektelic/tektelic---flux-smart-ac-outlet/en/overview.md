### TEKTELIC - Flux Smart AC Outlet

#### Overview:

The TEKTELIC Flux Smart AC Outlet is an advanced IoT device designed for controlling and managing electricity consumption remotely. Utilizing breakthrough LoRaWAN technology, this smart outlet offers a robust, efficient, and secure solution for energy management in various settings, including homes, offices, and other commercial spaces.

#### Working Principles:

The Flux Smart AC Outlet operates on the principles of LoRaWAN which provides long-range wireless connectivity. The device connects itself to a LoRaWAN gateway, enabling it to send and receive data from a central control center or app. Its functioning involves monitoring and controlling the power consumption of electronic devices plugged into it. With its smart algorithms, it can automate certain tasks, such as scheduling power on/off times, thus providing enhanced power management capabilities.

#### Installation Guide:

1. Plug the Flux Smart AC Outlet into a traditional wall outlet.
2. Connect it with a LoRaWAN gateway. This could be done by scanning the QR code on the device from the mobile application or manually entering the device EUI.
3. Configure the device using instructions provided in the mobile or web app.
4. Plug the electronic device to be controlled into the Flux Smart AC outlet.

#### LoRaWAN Details:

The TEKTELIC Flux Smart AC Outlet uses Low Power Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) technology. This ensures long-range connectivity and low power consumption. It operates in the license-free sub-gigahertz frequency bands, specifically ISM 868MHz (Europe) & 915MHz (North America). The device supports bi-directional communication with adaptive data rates from LoRaWAN Class A & C. 

#### Power Consumption:

This device is designed for high efficiency and low power consumption. It is a perfect tool for energy management and conservation. It operates at a wide voltage range of 110V to 240V AC, capable of handling devices with power ratings up to 10A. Details regarding its exact standby power will depend upon the specification provided by the manufacturer.

#### Use Cases:

1. Residential Buildings: For homeowners looking to reduce their electricity bills, this device allows them to monitor and manage the power consumption of their devices remotely.
2. Commercial Spaces: The Flux smart AC outlet can be used to control and regulate the use of office equipment, thus promoting energy efficiency.
3. Industrial Applications: In manufacturing units, this outlet can assist in equipment management and optimizing energy usage.

#### Limitations:

1. Dependence on LoRaWAN Network: The functionality of the smart AC outlet directly depends on the LoRaWAN network. In places with no LoRa coverage, its capabilities will be null.
2. Compatibility: It may not be compatible with some specific high power devices or machinery.
3. Single Plug: The device features a single plug, limiting its use for controlling multiple devices simultaneously.
