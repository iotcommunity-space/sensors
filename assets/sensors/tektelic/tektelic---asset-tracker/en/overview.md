### Technical Overview: TEKTELIC Asset Tracker

#### Working Principles

The TEKTELIC Asset Tracker is a highly adaptable and comprehensive solution designed to manage and track the movement and condition of valuable assets. The device employs GPS, Wi-Fi, and cell-ID positioning techniques to determine the accurate location of the asset. In addition, it uses various on-board sensors to report the status and condition of the asset, including temperature, humidity, pressure, tilt, impact, and light detection.

Adopting LoRaWAN technology, the Asset Tracker communicates with network servers to transmit the collected sensor data. The low-power, long-range nature of LoRA provides efficient, reliable, and secure data transmission, making it apt for Internet of Things (IoT) devices like the Asset Tracker.

#### Installation Guide

To install the TEKTELIC Asset Tracker, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that your tracker is charged and turned on. The power button can be found on the top side of the device.
2. Position the device onto your chosen asset. For best performance, the device's top side (with the TEKTELIC logo) should face the sky.
3. If necessary, securely fasten the device using the included mounting hardware.
4. Finally, configure your tracker settings using the recommended software application.

#### LoRaWAN

The TEKTELIC Asset Tracker utilizes LoRaWAN technology (Long Range Wide Area Network), a communication protocol designed for long-range, low-power communications. It operates on the unlicensed band and allows for better penetration in urban and sub-urban settings. With adaptive data rate (ADR) mechanism, the device can optimize its data rate and power level to maximize battery life.

#### Power Consumption

The TEKTELIC Asset Tracker comes with a long battery life designed to support around 10 years of use under certain condition and installation settings, thanks to its optimized power consumption. The exact battery life, however, can vary depending on the frequency of location updates, strength of GPS signal, temperature, and other operating conditions.

#### Use Cases

The TEKTELIC Asset Tracker has a variety of use cases. It can be utilized in supply chain and logistics operations to monitor the location and condition of high-value and sensitive goods throughout the transport process. It is also beneficial in construction and industrial settings to keep track of expensive machinery and equipment. Furthermore, the device is extensively used for theft recovery and anti-counterfeit applications.

#### Limitations

While the TEKTELIC Asset Tracker is a robust and versatile device, it may have some limitations:

- Its LoRaWAN technology relies on signal availability which might limit its operation in certain geographies with no LoRaWAN network coverage.
- Although it boasts a long battery life, power consumption can further increase with frequent location updates and poor GPS signal strength, which can lead to a shorter battery lifespan.
- The device's sensors may not provide accurate readings if exposed to extreme environmental conditions, such as very high or low temperatures, high humidity, etc.
- The device does not have coverage in every country. It is important to check that the country in which you intend to use the device has coverage for the frequency band supported by the device.

In summary, the TEKTELIC Asset Tracker is a comprehensive tracking solution with a multitude of applications, powered by advanced LoRaWAN communication technology. It offers accurate readings and real-time information, maximizing the potential for asset safety, security, and efficient management.
