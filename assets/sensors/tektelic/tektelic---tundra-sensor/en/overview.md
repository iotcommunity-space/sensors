## TEKTELIC Tundra Sensor Overview

### Working Principles

The TEKTELIC Tundra Sensor is an advanced, Internet of Things (IOT) sensor based on Low-power, long-range wide area network (LoRaWAN) technology. Its primary function is to monitor temperature, humidity, and motion in a variety of environments, enabling data collection and monitoring of parameters essential for maintaining optimal conditions in those environments. The Tundra sensor utilizes LoRaWAN for data communication to offer seamless connectivity and efficient energy usage.

### Installation Guide

Installation of the TEKTELIC Tundra Sensor is simple:

1. Unbox the sensor and take out the backup battery from the packaging.
2. Open the battery compartment of the sensor and insert the battery. Make sure the battery is securely fitted.
3. Now connect your Tundra sensor with your LoRaWAN network. Ensure the sensor is within the range of your LoRaWAN gateway.
4. Position your tundra sensor in the location you wish to monitor. Use screws or adhesive provided to secure it into position.
5. Once installed, connect the sensor to your device's network and run the Tundra software to interpret the data collected by the sensor.

### LoRaWAN Details

The TEKTELIC Tundra Sensor utilizes the LoRaWAN technology for communication. This technology enables long-range transmissions of up to 15 kilometers (9 miles) in rural areas and 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) in urban areas. The device operates in the 868 MHz or 915 MHz frequency bands as per regional regulations. With its adaptive data rate feature, the sensor adjusts its data transmission rate according to the distance from the gateway.

### Power Consumption

One of the highlighting features of TEKTELIC Tundra Sensor is its low power consumption. Combined with the energy-efficient LoRaWAN technology, it can operate on a single C-cell battery for up to 10 years under standard conditions.

### Use Cases

The TEKTELIC Tundra Sensor is versatile and can be used in the following applications:

1. Climate control and monitoring in data centers.
2. Monitoring storage conditions in warehouses and cold storage.
3. Home security with its motion detection capability.
4. Environmental monitoring in agriculture and farming.

### Limitations

While the TEKTELIC Tundra Sensor offers many benefits, it also has a few limitations:

1. Due to reliance on wireless communication, its performance may be affected by structural interference and weather conditions.
2. While it has a long battery life, replacing the battery requires dismounting the device.
3. The range of data transmission may be decreased if the sensor is placed in areas with thick walls or numerous obstructions. The ideal placement of the sensor is in the line-of-sight of the gateway.
4. Although it has a broad range of industrial and commercial applications, it may not be suitable for all types of environment monitoring due to its selectivity for temperature, humidity, and motion parameters only.
