TEKTELIC Clover Agriculture Sensor Technical Overview

Working Principles: 

The TEKTELIC Clover Agriculture Sensor (TEKTELIC) is a specialized agricultural sensor that works by collecting data about the various environmental and soil properties of a particular area of land. The sensor gathers information relating to soil temperature, moisture, light intensity, and humidity, using these data to determine the optimal conditions for plant growth and health.

The primary components of the sensor are:
1. Soil Moisture Sensor: This measures the water content in soil.
2. Soil Temperature Sensor: This identifies the soil’s temperature conditions.
3. Ambient Light Sensor: This measures the intensity of light in the surrounding environment.
4. Humidity Sensor: This determines the humidity of the local atmosphere.

Installation Guide:

Installing the Clover Agriculture Sensor is a simple procedure that requires minimal tools: 

1. Identify the placement of the sensor. Choose an area where the sensor will not be physically disturbed and is representative of the larger field's conditions.
2. Insert the probe into the soil up to the marked line. The placement relies on the crop type and growth stage.
3. Mount the sensor unit in place. The device should be mounted vertically, with the top of the sensor pointing skyward. Ensure that the solar panel is not blocked.
4. Connect the sensor to your agricultural monitoring system (typically a computer or dedicated device), following the manufacturer's instructions.

LoRaWAN Details: 

TEKTELIC connects and communicates with cloud-based IoT platforms through the LoRaWAN (Low Range Wide Area Network) technology. The protocol allows for long-range communication up to 10 km in rural areas and consumes low power, enabling sensors to operate for an extended period without requiring a change of batteries.

Power Consumption:

TEKTELIC is powered by a Solar Panel and a 4000mAh replaceable Lithium Battery, hence ensuring that the sensor maintains a low power consumption and a long battery life. Its power-efficient design allows for approximately five years of operation before you need to replace the battery.

Use Cases:

1. Precision Farming: The sensor provides vital information enabling farmers to make informed decisions about irrigation, fertilization, and pest control.
2. Vineyards: Wine producers can use these sensors to assess the optimal time for grape harvest by monitoring soil moisture and temperature.
3. Research Institutes: The sensor is also useful for agricultural research institutes for studying various impacts and improvements on crop growth.

Limitations: 

Although the TEKTELIC Sensor provides several important agricultural measurements, it does have a few limitations:

1. Soil Compatibility: Not all types of soil are suitable for reliable sensor readings due to physical characteristics, such as rockiness or sandiness.
2. Limited Distances: While LoRaWAN does allow for long-distance communication, it still has a limited range. This might not be ideal for larger farming operations unless additional connectivity solutions are implemented.
3. False Readings: The sensor can give false readings if there are changes in soil density, solid matter in the soil, or water salinity.
4. Operational Temperature: The operational temperature is between -30°C to +70°C. Beyond these temperatures, the sensor may not function properly.
