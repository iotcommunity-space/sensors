# TEKTELIC - Finch Indoor Panic Button

## Overview

The TEKTELIC - Finch Indoor Panic Button is a highly reliable, state-of-the-art emergency response IoT device designed to offer user safety in various environments. The device operates primarily by triggering an immediate alert to a centralized system or specified individual in case of emergencies turn up.

## Working Principles

The panic button works on the simple principle of contact being established or disrupted. Upon pressing the panic button, it triggers an immediate notification signal transmitted via its LoRaWAN connectivity. This connectivity feature ensures that signals can efficiently reach even when used in crowded or indoor locations with many obstructions.

## Installation Guide

Installing the Finch Indoor Panic Button from TEKTELIC is straightforward.
1. Identify a suitable central location that is easy to access during emergencies but not easily triggered accidentally.
2. Attach the device to your chosen location using the included adhesive or through screw mounting points.
3. Connect the device to a LoRaWAN network according to manufacturer directions.

## LoRaWAN Details

The Finch Indoor Panic Button uses low-tower, wide-range LoRaWAN technology, enabling it to reach network gateways from large distances, up to several kilometers, even in built-up areas. It supports LoRaWAN 1.0.2 and has adaptive data rate capabilities, allowing for efficient power management and extended battery life.

## Power Consumption

The Finch Indoor Panic Button is renowned for its low power consumption. Its high-efficiency electrical system ensures extended lifespan for the included battery, lasting up to several years depending on usage. The device only transmits when the panic button is pressed and therefore has a low standby power usage.

## Use Cases

This device is applicable across a broad range of situations. It's useful in care homes for seniors to quickly alert care providers during emergencies. It's also applicable in home and office security systems, rapidly signaling an intrusion, and in various facilities like schools and hospitals where swift communication is required during a crisis.

## Limitations

Despite its numerous advantages, there are a few limitations. The device solely relies on the LoRaWAN network, and its coverage might be challenging in areas with weak connectivity or in underground facilities. Also, it only notifies once the button is pressed, meaning it might not be useful for situations where the user can't physically press it. Lastly, it requires a network server and application server setup to receive and interpret the alerts sent from the device.

In conclusion, the TEKTELIC - Finch Indoor Panic Button combines simplicity, reliability, and state-of-the-art technology to provide excellent emergency response capabilities. By offering a low power, long-range communication option through LoRaWAN, it ensures alerts are efficiently and quickly sent, thus making the environment safer.
