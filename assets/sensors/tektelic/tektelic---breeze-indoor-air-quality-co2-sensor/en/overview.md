**TEKTELIC Breeze Indoor Air Quality Co2 Sensor**

**Technical Overview**

TEKTELICâ€™s Breeze Indoor Air Quality CO2 Sensor is an advanced, IoT-enabled device for continuous monitoring of air quality by assessing the level of carbon dioxide (CO2) in indoor environments. Its core working principle is based on non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) technology, which measures CO2 concentration. The sensor has a Built-in Temperature and Humidity monitoring feature for comprehensive Indoor Air Quality Monitoring.

**Working Principles**

The sensor leverages NDIR technology to identify CO2 molecules based on their spectral absorption characteristics specific to the infrared spectrum. NDIR CO2 sensors are designed to detect and measure CO2 concentration in the air by emitting an infrared light into a sample chamber and measuring the amount of light absorbed by the CO2 molecules. They also compensate for temperature differences by monitoring temperature and humidity conditions.

**Installation Guide**

Installing the TEKTELIC Breeze Indoor Air Quality CO2 Sensor is a straightforward process. It is meant to be installed in an indoor environment and should be placed at an average breathing height (approximately 5 feet from the ground). The sensor should be mounted on a flat wall, away from direct sunlight, heating, or ventilation equipment. The device is powered up by plugging the provided adapter to a power source and the sensor.

**LoRaWAN Details**

The sensor works with LoRaWan protocol, a low power, long-range wide area network protocol designed for IoT devices. It is configured to automatically send the captured data at specified intervals to a predefined LoRaWAN gateway. The gateway then routes the data to a network server, making it accessible from anywhere via the cloud.

**Power Consumption**

The indoor air quality CO2 sensor has a low power consumption design, ensuring a long-life operation. The product's exact power consumption may vary based on the specific use case and configuration settings, but in general, its design is optimized around energy-efficient operation.

**Use Cases**

The sensor is particularly useful for buildings with a high density of occupants, such as schools, healthcare facilities, offices, commercial buildings or residential homes. Ensuring CO2 and humidity levels are within safe, comfortable limits can lead to improved health, wellness and productivity.

**Limitations**

While NDIR technology is accurate and reliable, it can only detect and measure CO2, not other potential pollutants in the indoor environment. Also, though the sensor is designed for energy efficiency, it requires a direct power source, which may limit where it can be installed. Lastly, its reliance on LoRaWAN means it needs a nearby network gateway for proper operation and this might limit its use in areas where LoRa coverage is weak.
