## Technical Overview for TEKTELIC - Orca Industrial GPS Tracker (TEKTELIC)

### Working Principles

The TEKTELIC Orca Industrial GPS Tracker is a LoRaWAN-enabled device that maintains a dual operation system; it primarily locates assets through GPS and also employs accelerometer inputs. The device actively acquires GPS coordinates and LoRaWAN antenna diversity, in conjunction with the accelerometer, to intelligently update and transmit the device's location. 

The sophisticated firmware algorithm used in the device allows for advanced power-saving modes, smart movement detection, and geofencing capabilities, enabling optimal battery life and efficient location tracking.

### Installation Guide

1. Open the device packaging and inspect the contents for any damage.
2. Mount the device on the asset to be tracked. 
3. Ensure the device is positioned with maximum exposure to the sky for optimal GPS reception.
4. Activate the device by installing the battery according to the instruction manual.
5. Use the TEKTELIC Device Manager Platform or another preferred LoRaWAN network server to register and manage the device.
6. The device starts transmitting location data once it detects movement.

### LoRaWAN Details

The TEKTELIC Orca Industrial GPS Tracker primarily communicates through LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network). This particular technology allows for longer range communication of small amounts of data, which perfect for GPS trackers. It uses the industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) radio band, specifically the sub-gigahertz spectrum.

The device supports LoRaWAN specification 1.0.2 and can be operated in all LoRaWAN classes, A, B, and C, adjusting to varying network requirements.

### Power Consumption

The device's power consumption changes depending on its scenario of operation, but its sophisticated firmware algorithm allows it to optimize battery life regardless. It can operate continuously for several years on a single ER34615 cell battery depending on configuration and LoRaWAN settings.

### Use Cases

The TEKTELIC Orca Industrial GPS Tracker is ideal for numerous applications due to its superior wireless reach, robust construction, and long battery life. These include asset tracking in industrial environments, fleet tracking, agricultural machinery monitoring, and outdoor surveillance among others.

### Limitations 

Despite its numerous advantages:

1. The tracker may struggle for optimal GPS reception in areas with poor sky view, such as dense urban areas or indoors.
2. Its reliance on LoRaWAN for communication may be a limitation in regions with poor or no LoRaWAN coverage.
3. The device may not track the absolute location due to GPS margin of error depending on the surrounding environment.
4. It requires manual activation and set-up, which may not be user-friendly to all users.

Overall, the TEKTELIC Orca Industrial GPS Tracker is a highly capable device for numerous tracking applications, designed for longer lifespan, ease of installation, and minimal maintenance.
