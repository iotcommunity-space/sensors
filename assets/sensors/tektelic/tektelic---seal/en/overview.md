TEKTELIC - Seal (TEKTELIC) SENSOR TECHNICAL OVERVIEW

# Working Principles
TEKTELIC - Seal operates through a suite of sensors integrated into its framework. Leveraging the latest in IoT and wireless communication technologies, it is designed to collect and transmit data from within its environment. The device uses LoRaWAN technology for communication, providing long-range, low-power wireless connectivity.

# Installation
* Drill holes and secure the device to a wall, floor, or surface using provided screws. 
* Upon installation, configure the device through its user interface. 
* For LoRaWAN configuration, it is crucial to register the device's EUI with your LoRaWAN network server. 

# LoRaWAN Details
TEKTELIC - Seal uses LoRaWAN technology for data communication. It operates at a LoRaWAN frequency band of 868 MHz in Europe and 915 MHz in North America. This allows long-range (15-30 km or 9-18 miles in rural areas; 2-5 km or 1-3 miles in urban areas) and long-lasting battery life with low power consumption.

# Power Consumption
TEKTELIC - Seal is built with industry-leading low power operation technology. The sensor reporting frequency, low-power LoRaWAN transmission, and excellent energy management protocol contribute to a battery life of 10+ years.

# Use Cases
TEKTELIC - Seal is primarily designed for Industrial IoT applications. It is ideally suited for environmental monitoring, facility management, smart agriculture, and energy management scenarios. The sensor is especially reliable in reporting environmental parameters like temperature, humidity, pressure, light, and movement.

# Limitations
* While the sensor is designed for long-range and low-power operation, its actual range can be considerably affected by natural and artificial obstructions. 
* TEKTELIC - Seal operates best within a certain temperature and humidity range; hence, extreme environmental conditions may lead to inaccurate results or degrade sensor performance.
* Although the device's installation is straightforward, the initial setup of the device and the LoRaWAN network configuration might require technical expertise to a certain extent.
* The device uses long-life batteries, but depending on the usage frequency and environmental conditions, these batteries might need changing sooner than expected.
  
Despite its few limitations, the performance and advanced features of TEKTELIC - Seal make it one of the most versatile and reliable IoT devices in the market. Its robustness, easy installation, and accurate sensor readings remain unmatched, providing a huge boon for organizations desiring to leverage IoT for data-driven decision making.
