### TEKTELIC - Vivid Smart Room Occupancy Sensor Overview

**Working Principles**

The Vivid Smart Room Occupancy Sensor operates by monitoring changes in the environmental variables within its field of operation. Using passive infrared (PIR) sensor technology, this device detects movement by registering fluctuations in heat emissions from objects moving across the sensor's radial detection range. Through this, it is able to give accurate, real-time occupancy knowledge. It also incorporates an intelligent sensing algorithm to differentiate between incidental movements and genuine occupancy - thereby reducing chances of false triggers.

**Installation Guide**

The installation process of the Vivid Smart Room Occupancy Sensor is user-friendly and straightforward. The device can be wall-mounted or placed on a flat surface depending on preference or room layout. It comes with an easy-to-use mount that can be secured using screws or adhesive pads.

Steps:
1. Connect the sensor with a power source.
2. Link the sensor to your LoRaWAN network.
3. Mount the sensor in your preferred location within your room.
4. Initiate a test run to ensure the sensor is functioning correctly.

**LoRaWAN Details**

The Vivid Smart Room Occupancy Sensor employs LoRaWAN communication protocol for connecting to your network. This long-range and low-power wireless technology allows the sensor to transmit occupancy data over a vast range, and in real-time, to your network server. The sensor supports LoRaWAN 1.0.2 and 1.1.

**Power Consumption**

This device is designed for energy efficiency. It operates on two AA Lithium batteries. Its optimized power consumption ensures extended lifetime, which can extend up to five years depending on usage conditions and data report frequency.

**Use Cases**

The Vivid Smart Room Occupancy Sensor can be employed in various contexts such as:

- Office spaces or commercial buildings to monitor room usage and optimize energy consumption.
- Aged care or healthcare facilities to monitor patient movements without invading their privacy.
- Smart-home implementation for controlling automated lighting or HVAC system based on room occupancy.
- In educational institutions to monitor classroom usage.

**Limitations**

While the Vivid Smart Room Occupancy Sensor is undoubtedly versatile and capable, it does have a few potential drawbacks to be aware of:

- The sensor's accuracy may be affected in environments with a high amount of movement or heat fluctuations that can cause false trigger.
- The coverage area is usually limited to direct line of sight and the range may vary based on the environment.
- Requires a LoRaWAN gateway for data relay.
- Battery life can be decreased by high data transmission rates, environmental conditions, and the strength of the connection to the LoRaWAN network.
- Non-ideal for monitoring large and open spaces as the sensor's detection might not cover the entire area accurately.
  
Keep these considerations in mind when deploying the Vivid Smart Room Occupancy Sensor to ensure it will meet your requirements effectively.
