## Technical Overview - TEKTELIC - Cold Room

### Working Principles
The TEKTELIC Cold Room IoT sensor is a specialized wireless device designed to monitor and report the environmental conditions, particularly temperature and humidity, within cold rooms for industrial or commercial use. The key principle of its operation relies on the quantification of these environmental variables via integrated sensors and then transmitting this data to a centralized system using LoRaWAN wireless technology, ensuring informed decision-making on energy management, quality control, and safety.

### Installation Guide
To install the TEKTELIC Cold Room sensor, follow these steps:

1. **Device Location**: Choose a suitable location within the cold room where the sensor can accurately monitor the environmental conditions. Avoid areas near doors or vents to prevent inaccurate readings.

2. **Mounting**: Use the provided mounting hardware to securely install the sensor on your chosen location. 

3. **Configure**: Connect to the device using a LoRaWAN gateway to configure it to your specifications.

4. **Test**: Finally, test the sensor to ensure it’s working properly and transmitting data correctly to your data management system.

### LoRaWAN Details
TEKTELIC Cold Room deploys Long Range WAN (LoRaWAN) technology, a modulation scheme that allows low-power, wide-area communication with IoT devices. It operates in multiple global frequencies (868 MHz EU, 915 MHz US). Its adaptive data rate algorithm improves battery lifetime, network capacity, and scalability.

### Power Consumption
TEKTELIC Cold Room sensor is powered by high-capacity industrial batteries, optimized to accommodate long-term applications with very low power consumption. Its exact power consumption varies on factors such as transmission frequency and environmental conditions.

### Use Cases
TEKTELIC Cold Room sensor is applied in various industrial and commercial fields:

1. **Food & Beverage Industry**: It helps ensuring quality observance by continuously monitoring refrigeration units’ temperatures.  

2. **Pharmaceuticals**: Monitor and maintain specific conditions in cold storage facilities to ensure the efficacy and safety of temperature-sensitive drugs.

3. **Retail**: It is used in supermarkets to monitor the environment in cold storage to maintain the freshness of perishable products.

### Limitations
Despite its many benefits, TEKTELIC Cold Room sensor also has a number of limitations:

1. **Coverage Limitation**: LoRaWAN technology provides a wide coverage, but this can be limited by physical obstructions or distance in large commercial buildings or industrial parks.

2. **Sensor Accuracy**: Although largely accurate, readings may be slightly affected by sudden changes in environmental conditions or placement of the device.

3. **Power Constraints**: Even though the sensor is optimized for low power consumption, regular battery checks and replacements are crucial for optimum performance. If neglected, it could lead to data loss and consequent management issues.

4. **Limited Data Bandwidth**: Being a low-power, wide-area network, LoRaWAN has a relatively low data rate, which may limit real-time data transfer and immediate insights, especially with high numbers of nodes.
