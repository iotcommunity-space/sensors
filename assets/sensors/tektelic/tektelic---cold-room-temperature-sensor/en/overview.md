**TEKTELIC – Cold Room Temperature Sensor Technical Overview**

1. **Working Principles**

   The TEKTELIC Cold Room Temperature Sensor utilizes an embedded thermistor to accurately measure temperatures in cold environments ranging from -40°C to +85°C. It collects real-time temperature data and wirelessly transmits the gathered information through LoRaWAN technology to a remote system for analysis and continuous temperature regulation measures. It is designed with advanced RF engineering features to achieve the best-in-class battery life and extended range of operation.

2. **Installation Guide**

   The installation of TEKTELIC Cold Room Temperature Sensor requires careful placement in a representative area of the cold room. It should be located at an optimal position, typically at a mid-level height in the room. The sensor should be mounted away from direct chillers or heat-producing objects to prevent any interference with data accuracy. Once the ideal location has been determined, the sensor is mounted on the wall or any flat surface using the provided mounting brackets. When securely in place, the sensor is powered up and configured to start monitoring the temperature.

3. **LoRaWAN Details**

    The TEKTELIC Cold Room Temperature Sensor is equipped with the Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN), a network technology designed for long-range, low-power communications. This protocol enables the sensors to transmit collected data over a vast distance (approximately 2km to 5km in urban areas and 15km in open spaces) with low power consumption. This sensor supports the LoRaWAN protocol version 1.0.2.

4. **Power Consumption**

    The sensor is powered by a 3.6V AA lithium battery. It has been optimized for minimal power consumption, allowing for a remarkable battery life of up to ten years with the default configuration. Such an efficient energy use at reduced transmission rates significantly extends the device's lifespan, reducing the need for frequent battery replacement and thereby lowering operating costs.

5. **Use Cases**

    Primarily, TEKTELIC Cold Room Temperature Sensor is used for temperature monitoring in cold storage areas such as freezers, refrigeration units, and cold warehouses in supermarkets, food processing units, pharmaceutical industries, and various other cold chain logistics. It helps maintain an optimal temperature ensuring quality and preservation by alerting the users if the temperature falls beyond the predefined parameter.

6. **Limitations**
   
    While TEKTELIC Cold Room Temperature Sensor is optimally designed for cold room conditions, it has some limitations. It has a defined operating temperature limit, and exposure to conditions beyond this range might affect its performance and accuracy. Another disadvantage is its reliance on LoRaWAN coverage for communication. If a cold room is placed in a location with poor or no network coverage, data transmission may become a challenge. Lastly, although measures have been taken to minimize power consumption, battery life expectancy can still be influenced by the transmission frequency and signal strength.
