## TEKTELIC - Industrial Transceiver Technical Documentation

### Overview

The TEKTELIC Industrial Transceiver is an advanced sensor device based on IoT (Internet of Things) technology, specifically developed for industrial applications. This device is capable of transmitting and receiving digital signals over long distances in industrial conditions, through the adoption of the LoRaWAN (Low Range Wide Area Network) protocol.

### Working Principle

TEKTELIC Transceiver uses LoRa (Long Range) modulation technique for communication which allows data transmission over large distances with very low power consumption. The device transforms the input data (collected from the industrial operations) into an encoded digital format that can be transmitted wirelessly through its radio frequency (RF) component. The receiver device on the other end of the network decodes this transmitted data back into its original format.

### Installation Guide

The installation of the TEKTELIC Transceiver involves a few simple steps:

1. Mount the transceiver in the appropriate location using the provided mounting kit. Ensure it is secure and free from interference.
2. Plug in the power supply and connect the device to the LoRaWAN network.
3. Use the built-in interface to configure the device: input the necessary network parameters and device credentials (such as DevEUI, AppKey, and AppEUI in case of OTAA, or Network Session Key and Device Address for ABP).
4. Once configured and network-connected, the transceiver is ready to transmit and receive data from other devices within the network.

### LoRaWAN Details

TEKTELIC Transceiver uses the LoRaWAN protocol which uses sub-gigahertz radio frequency bands. This protocol is designed for wide area networks aiming for long-range transmissions with minimal power consumption. TEKTELIC's transceiver supports different LoRaWAN specifications based on the region like AS923, AU915, EU868, or US915.

### Power Consumption

The TEKTELIC Industrial Transceiver boasts very low power consumption due to its effective RF module and the efficiency of the LoRaWAN protocol. Due to its efficient power management system, it can operate on battery power for extended periods, making it perfect for installations where power supply might be irregular or limited.

### Use Cases

TEKTELIC Industrial Transceiver finds a wide range of applications in numerous industries:

1. In the manufacturing and automation sector, the transceiver can wirelessly communicate critical data from machines to control systems.
2. In telecom industries, it can contribute to establishing IoT networks to monitor and control remote base stations.
3. For transport and logistics, the device can help in tracking and monitoring fleets, containers, and packages in real-time.
4. In the energy sector, it is used for real-time monitoring of remote installations and efficient energy management. 

### Limitations

While TEKTELIC Transceiver is a powerful device, it does have some limitations:

1. Transmission range and quality can be affected by physical obstacles or electromagnetic interference, common in industrial environments.
2. The device might not be suitable for applications requiring real-time or very high data rate transmission, due to inherent LoRaWAN latency and low data rate characteristics.
3. While the device boasts low-power consumption, it does require a reliable power source, which might be a challenge in certain remote or off-grid installations.
4. The choice of LoRaWAN frequency and parameters should comply with local regulations, limiting its operability in some geographical areas.
