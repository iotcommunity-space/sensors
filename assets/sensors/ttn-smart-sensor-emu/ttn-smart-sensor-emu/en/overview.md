**TTN Smart Sensor (Emu) - Technical Overview**

1. **Overview & Working Principles**

   The TTN Smart Sensor (Emu) harnesses the power of LoRaWAN (Low-Power, Long-Range Wide Area Networks) technologies to provide reliable, efficient, and convenient sensing for a broad array of data types. Utilizing a high-quality sensor suite, it can gather information on ambient temperature, humidity, light levels, and more; this data is then relayed back to a central system for processing and analysis.

2. **Installation**

   To install the Emu sensor, first locate the optimal place where the environmental variables you intend to monitor are most evident. Fix the sensor on this spot using the provided mounts. Next, take the device online by connecting it to your LoRaWAN gateway which should be functioning within its network range. The sensor's onboard LED will flash to confirm successful connection.

3. **LoRaWAN Details**

   Emu utilizes LoRaWAN Class A bi-directional communication protocol. It works in different ISM bands according to the geographical areas (868 MHz for EU, 915 MHz for US, etc.) Its packets can be detected up to several kilometers away, even in hostile urban environments. It uses adaptive data rate (ADR) feature of LoRaWAN which optimizes data rate, airtime and energy consumption.

4. **Power Consumption**

   TTN Emu Sensor is configured for low power consumption making it especially suitable for battery-driven installations. The particular power draw will depend on the operating conditions, but in idle mode, the sensor draws almost negligible power. The power consumption increases when data is being transmitted, but thanks to the inherent efficiency of LoRa technology, this is kept to a minimum.

5. **Use Cases**

   The varied sensing capabilities of the Emu sensor make it ideal for numerous applications. It is commonly used in supply chain monitoring, to track temperature, humidity, or light exposure of goods and in smart buildings and homes to monitor environmental conditions. Agriculture also benefits from its use, notably in precision farming. It is used to monitor soil moisture, light, temperature, improving crop yield and efficiency.

6. **Limitations**

   For all the strengths of TTN Emu Sensor, there are specific limitations. The transmission range can be significantly reduced by physical obstacles and the surrounding environment. While it's designed for low power consumption, power is still a limiting factor; frequent data transmission can deplete the battery quickly. Lastly, despite being able to monitor many environmental parameters, it is not suitable for monitoring highly-sensitive or extreme conditions. 

In conclusion, the TTN Emu Sensor provides a versatile and efficient solution for IoT sensing needs across a wide range of applications, with only a few limitations to consider before implementing.
