**Myriota Custom MyrIoTA Sensor Technical Documentation**

**1. Overview:**

The Myriota Custom MyrIoTA Sensor is a highly sophisticated, programmable, low-power IoT (Internet of Things) sensor device. Myriota utilizes powerful first-of-its-kind technology to provide more accessible direct-to orbit satellite IoT connectivity. Its broad operational reach ensures enhanced sustainability and improved informational accessibility.

**2. Working principles:**

Myriota operates on LPWAN (Low Power Wide Area Network) technology which facilitates the connection between devices over long ranges, providing full global coverage using a constellation of low Earth orbiting (LEO) Myriota Network satellites. With its unique message scheduling system and patented chirp spread spectrum radio, Myriota assures data communication reliability. It uses a store-and-forward system to effectively communicate messages between the device and overhead satellites.

**3. Installation Guide:**

Step 1: Attach the antenna to the Myriota sensor module.   
Step 2: Connect the power supply to the sensor. 
Step 3: Securely mount the sensor and position the antenna for the best coverage.  
Step 4: Register the device online, using its unique device and encryption codes.

**4. LoRaWAN details:**

Despite being a popular LPWAN choice, Myriota does not explicitly rely on LoRaWAN technology. While LoRaWAN is a widely used medium for terrestrial, shorter-range IoT data communication, Myriota uses its satellite system to provide remote, more extensive coverage.

**5. Power consumption:**

The Myriota module delivers power resourcefully. With minimal energy requirements for operational services, it supports an extended battery life and can run for several years depending on data message frequency. Its sleep mode functionality further helps in reducing power consumption.

**6. Use cases:**

The Myriota module is suited to a wide array of applications, including remote monitoring, weather stations, agriculture & farming, logistics and asset tracking, water quality testing, and much more. Mainly, it provides value in applications where continuous remote connectivity and minimal maintenance are expected.

**7. Limitations:**

The Myriota sensor excels in communicating small amounts of arbitrary data but is not designed to support live streaming or real-time interactive communication. Possible communication delays may occur dependent on the satellite's availability and the deviceâ€™s visibility to the sky. The device can resist an extent of severe weather conditions, however, significantly harsh or adverse environmental conditions might impact its performance. Also, it requires clear visibility to the sky for the communication, hence, cannot be used for underground purposes.
