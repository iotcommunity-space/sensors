# Technical Overview for DECENTLAB DL-ALB

The DECENTLAB DL-ALB is a versatile, high-precision wireless sensor designed for monitoring ammonia (NH3) concentrations in various environments. Operating on LoRaWAN networks, the sensor provides robust performance and reliable data transmission over long distances, making it ideal for industrial and environmental monitoring applications. This overview covers its working principles, installation, LoRaWAN details, power consumption, potential use cases, and limitations.

## Working Principles

The DL-ALB utilizes an electrochemical sensor to detect the presence and concentration of ammonia gas. The electrochemical sensor consists of a sensing electrode, a counter electrode, and an electrolyte. When ammonia gas comes into contact with the sensor, a chemical reaction occurs, generating an electric current proportional to the ammonia concentration. This current is then converted into a digital signal for transmission. The sensor is characterized by high sensitivity, selectivity, and low cross-sensitivity to other gases.

## Installation Guide

### Step 1: Site Selection
- Choose a location that represents the general air conditions of the area being monitored.
- Install the sensor away from localized ammonia sources unless monitoring at the source is intended.

### Step 2: Mounting
- The sensor should be installed vertically with the sensor grid facing the ambient air.
- Secure the sensor using the mounting kit provided, ensuring it is stable and protected against physical impact.

### Step 3: Powering the Device
- Ensure the device is equipped with a fully charged lithium battery pack.
- Insert the battery into the compartment, aligning the contacts correctly.

### Step 4: Activation
- Switch on the device using the activation button.
- Check the LED indicators for proper functionality.

### Step 5: Initial Configuration
- Use the DECENTLAB Toolset application or web interface to connect to the device via Bluetooth.
- Configure sensor parameters, including measurement intervals and thresholds.

### Step 6: LoRaWAN Network Configuration
- Register the device on your LoRaWAN network server using the provided device EUI and AppKey.
- Confirm network connectivity and successful data transmission.

## Power Consumption

The DL-ALB is designed for ultra-low power consumption, with the ability to operate for several years on a single battery pack, depending on the measurement interval and conditions:

- **Typical Current Draw**: Approximately 10 ÂµA in sleep mode.
- **Measurement and Transmission**: Peaks at about 40 mA during active sensing and data transmission.
- **Battery Life**: Estimated 3-5 years with hourly measurements and ADR enabled.

## Use Cases

The DL-ALB sensor is ideal for various applications, including:

- **Agriculture**: Monitoring ammonia levels in livestock facilities to ensure animal health and safety.
- **Industrial Settings**: Detecting ammonia leaks in refrigeration systems and chemical plants.
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Assessing air quality near agricultural operations and urban areas.
- **Waste Management**: Managing emissions from facilities handling animal waste and sewage.

## Limitations

- **Environmental Range**: The sensor's optimal performance may be affected by extreme temperatures and humidity.
- **Calibration**: Periodic calibration may be required to maintain accuracy, especially in environments with high ammonia concentrations or when exposed to interfering gases.
- **Transmission Range**: While LoRaWAN provides extensive coverage, physical obstacles and interference can limit effective transmission distance.
- **Cross-Sensitivity**: Although designed for selectivity, some interference from similar gases can occur under specific conditions.

In conclusion, the DECENTLAB DL-ALB is a powerful tool for continuous ammonia monitoring, particularly well-suited for applications requiring long-distance wireless communication and low power usage. However, users must consider environmental factors and maintenance needs to maximize its utility and accuracy.
