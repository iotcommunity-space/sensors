## Technical Overview of ADVANTECH - WISE-2410X

The ADVANTECH WISE-2410X is an advanced vibration sensor designed for industrial IoT applications. It is used primarily for predictive maintenance by monitoring equipment health through vibration analysis and delivering data via LoRaWAN networks.

### Working Principles

The WISE-2410X operates on the principle of vibration analysis. It utilizes a micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) accelerometer to measure vibration velocity and acceleration. The device converts these physical vibrations into electrical signals that can be analyzed to determine different vibration parameters, including RMS velocity, peak acceleration, and FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) analysis for frequency components.

### Installation Guide

1. **Site Selection**: Install the sensor on the surface of the equipment where vibration monitoring is required. It's crucial to choose a location that provides representative vibration data for analysis.

2. **Mounting**: Use the included mounting bracket or adhesive pads to secure the sensor. Ensure that the mounting surface is clean and flat to prevent measurement inaccuracies.

3. **Orientation**: For best results, align the sensor’s axis with the machine's rotational axis. The sensor should be firmly attached to minimize relative movement between the device and the machine.

4. **Configuration**: Configure the sensor via its USB interface before deployment. This setup will involve setting thresholds for alerts, data transmission intervals, and other parameters as required.

5. **Power-On**: Connect the sensor to a power source. The WISE-2410X typically operates on a battery supply but can also be connected to an external power source for continuous use.

6. **Network Connectivity**: Ensure the sensor is added and properly integrated into the existing LoRaWAN network using credentials such as Device EUI, Application EUI, and App Key.

### LoRaWAN Details

The WISE-2410X is equipped with LoRaWAN connectivity, allowing it to transmit data over long distances with low power consumption. The device supports the LoRaWAN 1.0.2 protocol, ensuring compatibility with most public and private LoRa gateways.

**Frequency Bands**: Operates on multiple frequency bands (e.g., EU868, US915) to support global deployments.

**Data Transmission**: The default transmission interval can be adjusted, but typically it sends data every 30 minutes or upon detecting anomalous vibration patterns. End nodes send data using Class A or Class C operation modes, which provide a balance between power efficiency and timely data transmission.

### Power Consumption

The WISE-2410X is designed with low power consumption in mind, making it suitable for battery-operated environments. Operating with an average power consumption of approximately 0.1 µA in sleep mode and drawing up to 50 mA when actively transmitting data, it can typically last up to 2 years on its built-in battery, depending on the reporting interval and environmental conditions.

### Use Cases

- **Predictive Maintenance**: Monitors the health of rotating machinery to predict potential failures, reducing downtime and maintenance costs.
- **Industrial Automation**: Used in factory floors where real-time data on machinery health can optimize processes and workflows.
- **Energy Monitoring**: Helps in assessing the energy consumption and efficiency of different equipment by analyzing vibrational patterns.
- **Structural Health Monitoring**: Deployed in buildings and infrastructure to detect irregular vibrations that could indicate structural weaknesses or fatigue.

### Limitations

- **Communication Range**: As with any LoRaWAN device, the transmission range can be affected by environmental factors such as physical obstructions and weather conditions.
- **Data Latency**: While LoRaWAN provides wide coverage, it may not be suitable for applications requiring real-time data delivery due to inherent latency.
- **Sensor Drift**: Over extended periods, there may be drift in sensor readings which requires periodic recalibration.
- **Limited Edge Processing Capabilities**: Although it can perform FFT analysis, more complex data processing might require external computing resources.

Overall, the ADVANTECH WISE-2410X provides a robust solution for vibration monitoring in various industrial applications, thanks to its efficient LoRaWAN connectivity, low power usage, and versatile use cases.
