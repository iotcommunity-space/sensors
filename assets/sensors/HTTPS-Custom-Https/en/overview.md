# HTTPS - Custom Https () Sensor

## Technical Overview

The HTTPS - Custom Https () is a versatile IoT sensor designed for secure data transmission over the internet using the HTTPS protocol. This sensor is part of a robust IoT ecosystem tailored for applications requiring high security for data integrity and confidentiality during transmission. It is typically employed in environments demanding secure communication, such as industrial control systems, smart cities, and critical infrastructure monitoring.

### Working Principles

The HTTPS - Custom Https () sensor operates by capturing environmental or status metrics through an array of sensors which might include temperature, humidity, pressure, motion, or whatever functionality is integrated. These data points are encapsulated and sent to a central server over the HTTPS protocol. By leveraging HTTPS, all communication between the sensor and the server is encrypted, ensuring that data is protected from interception or tampering during transit.

Key features include:
- **TLS/SSL encryption:** Ensures communication security.
- **Endpoint Authentication:** Verifies the identity of the server before data transmission.
- **Integrity Check:** Guarantees that data has not been altered in transit.

### Installation Guide

1. **Unboxing and Inspection:**
   - Carefully unbox the sensor ensuring all components are present.
   - Inspect for any visible damages.

2. **Power Supply:**
   - Connect the sensor to an appropriate power source as per the specifications.

3. **Network Configuration:**
   - Connect the sensor to a Wi-Fi network. This may require using a dedicated app or web portal provided by the manufacturer.
   - Ensure that your router's firewall allows outbound HTTPS traffic.

4. **Server Configuration:**
   - Configure the server endpoint by inputting the server URL and ensuring it supports HTTPS.
   - Upload the server's SSL certificate to the sensor's configuration panel if required.

5. **Sensor Calibration (if applicable):**
   - Follow specific procedures for calibrating each sensor type according to the manufacturer's instructions.

6. **Testing and Validation:**
   - Initiate a data transmission test to ensure that the sensor correctly sends data to the server.
   - Verify that the received data is accurate and falls within expected parameters.

### LoRaWAN Details

Though primarily an HTTPS-based sensor, integration with LoRaWAN can be optional for expansive deployments or areas without stable internet. LoRaWAN can be utilized for:
- **Long-range communication:** Suitable for rural or spread-out installations.
- **Low power consumption:** Adept for battery-operated deployments where frequent battery replacement is untenable.

Integration into a LoRaWAN ecosystem involves configuring a LoRaWAN gateway and setting the device parameters accordingly, working as a hybrid system where bulk data uses HTTPS and periodic readings use LoRaWAN.

### Power Consumption

The power consumption of the HTTPS - Custom Https () sensor depends on its operational mode and transmission frequency:
- **Active Mode:** When capturing data and transmitting. Power draw ranges from 100 mA to 300 mA.
- **Sleep Mode:** Enabled between transmissions to conserve energy, reducing power consumption to 10 mA or less.

To optimize power efficiency, the sensor supports programmable sleep cycles and data transmission intervals.

### Use Cases

- **Industrial Monitoring:** Secure transmission of machine operational data.
- **Smart City Applications:** Ensuring the integrity of environmental data and urban infrastructure metrics.
- **Critical Infrastructure:** Monitoring systems for utilities ensuring data privacy.
- **Healthcare Applications:** Remote patient monitoring where data confidentiality is crucial.

### Limitations

- **Connectivity Dependency:** Requires stable internet connectivity for HTTPS operations, although LoRaWAN can mitigate this in select scenarios.
- **Configuration Complexity:** Initial setup may be complex for users unfamiliar with network security protocols.
- **Power Availability:** Inherently requires reliable power supply or periodic battery replacements, potentially increasing maintenance overhead.
- **Limited Range without LoRaWAN:** Purely HTTPS mode confines the device to areas with Wi-Fi coverage unless paired with LoRaWAN.

In conclusion, the HTTPS - Custom Https () sensor is engineered for environments demanding reliable, secure communication. It is a forward-looking component within IoT infrastructures, blending data security with practical functionality across diverse applications.
