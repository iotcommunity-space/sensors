# Vs-Series - Vs133 Technical Overview

The Vs133 from the Vs-Series is an advanced sensor designed for smart monitoring applications leveraging LoRaWAN connectivity. This document provides a detailed insight into its working principles, installation process, LoRaWAN integration, power metrics, potential use cases, and acknowledged limitations.

## Working Principles

The Vs133 sensor utilizes a combination of sensing technologies to collect environmental data. At its core, it features a MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) sensor array that can detect variations in specific environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, and other customizable data points depending on the specific model configuration. 

Data is processed through an onboard microcontroller, which uses advanced algorithms to filter and prepare the data for transmission. The sensor operates with a high degree of precision, ensuring minimal drift and consistent output over time.

## Installation Guide

### Requirements
- Compatible LoRaWAN gateway within range.
- Access to the installation site with appropriate environmental conditions for accurate readings.
- Standard mounting tools for secure placement.

### Installation Steps
1. **Site Survey**: Ensure the installation site is within the operating temperature and humidity range specified for the sensor. Additionally, confirm the presence of a LoRaWAN gateway signal.
   
2. **Physical Mounting**: 
   - Use the provided bracket and screws to mount the sensor securely. Ensure the sensor is mounted vertically for optimal performance.
   - Avoid placing near metallic surfaces or in direct proximity to large machinery that might interfere with signal transmission.

3. **Power Supply**:
   - Insert the specified batteries (typically AA Lithium for extended life) ensuring correct polarity.
   - For variants supporting external power sources, connect the appropriate DC power supply using the designated input terminal.

4. **Configuration**:
   - Use the manufacturer's app or provided configuration tool to set up the sensor's reporting intervals, thresholds, and other specific settings.
   - Ensure the LoRaWAN settings (e.g., DevEUI, AppEUI, AppKey) are accurately entered to enable network connectivity.

5. **Network Integration**:
   - Confirm connectivity to the LoRaWAN network by observing the LED indicators on the device after configuration.
