# Vs Series - Vs370 Technical Overview

The Vs Series - Vs370 is a cutting-edge sensor solution designed for seamless integration into IoT systems, particularly in scenarios requiring precise environmental monitoring. With advanced sensing capabilities and LoRaWAN connectivity, the Vs370 serves a breadth of applications from industrial automation to smart agriculture.

## Working Principles

The Vs370 leverages a combination of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and advanced digital sensors to measure a variety of parameters, depending on the specific model variant. Key sensing modalities include temperature, humidity, air pressure, and volatile organic compound (VOC) levels. It employs an onboard microcontroller that processes and transmits data via the LoRaWAN protocol, enabling long-range, low-power communication with IoT networks.

Data acquisition is conducted repetitively at user-configurable intervals. The sensor’s firmware can be updated over-the-air (OTA), ensuring the device can be adapted to meet evolving requirements and enhancements.

2. **Site Selection**
   - Choose an installation site that provides optimal exposure to the environmental parameters being monitored.
   - Ensure the site is within range of a LoRaWAN gateway for reliable data transmission.

3. **Mounting**
   - Secure the Vs370 using the provided mounting kit.
   - Ensure the sensor is oriented correctly as per environmental and design guidelines provided in the user manual.

4. **Power Setup**
   - The Vs370 supports both battery operation and wired power options (DC).
   - For battery power, install the specified battery type, ensuring proper polarity.
   - If using external DC power, connect using the included adapter following the polarity diagram.

5. **Configuration**
   - Power on the device.
   - Use the manufacturer’s configuration application to connect to the sensor, adjust settings, including data transmission intervals, and network parameters.

6. **Network Join**
   - Configure LoRaWAN parameters like Device EUI, Application EUI, and App Key.
   - Monitor LED indicators or use a network analyzer to ensure successful network join and data transmission.
