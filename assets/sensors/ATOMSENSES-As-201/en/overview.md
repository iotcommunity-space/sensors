Key features include its robust connectivity via LoRaWAN, low power consumption, and versatile use cases.

## Working Principles
The ATOMSENSES - AS 201 incorporates several sensing elements to measure environmental parameters:

- **Temperature Sensing**: Utilizes a digital temperature sensor with high accuracy and fast response time. 
- **Humidity Sensing**: Employs a capacitive humidity sensor that provides reliable readings across a wide range of conditions.
- **Air Quality Monitoring**: Detects various gases and particulate matter using dedicated sensors based on electrochemical and laser scattering technology.

These sensors internally process the data to filter noise and ensure consistent accuracy before transmitting the data through LoRaWAN.

## Installation Guide
To ensure optimal performance and data accuracy, follow these steps:

1. **Site Selection**: Choose a location that represents the area of interest without obstruction from nearby objects that can alter readings.
2. **Mounting**: The sensor can be pole-mounted or attached to a suitable surface using the provided brackets. Ensure it is securely fixed to prevent movement caused by wind or other factors.
3. **Power Supply**: Although primarily battery-powered, ensure the backup battery is adequately charged. Install the provided solar panel in locations with adequate sunlight for self-sustaining operation.
4. **Configuration**: Utilize the ATOMSENSES smart application to configure the device. Input necessary parameters such as reporting intervals, measurement units, and LoRaWAN configuration.
5. **Connectivity Check**: Verify LoRaWAN connectivity through the network server, ensuring that uplink and downlink parameters are correctly set.
