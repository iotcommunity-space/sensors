**Technical Overview: NETVOX - R72624 (NETVOX)**

**Working Principles**

The NETVOX - R72624 is a wireless temperature and humidity sensor that operates on Internet of Things (IoT) principles. It collects environmental data and transmits it via LoRaWAN technology. Collected data values can be evaluated and analyzed for numerous applications through an integrated system.

**Installation Guide**

To install the NETVOX - R72624, follow the steps below:

1. Mount the sensor in the desired location where temperature and humidity monitoring is needed.
2. Connect the sensor to the power source.
3. Configure the sensor according to the network specifications, ensuring it can connect to the designated LoRaWAN gateway.
4. Test the sensor to confirm itâ€™s working as expected.

**LoRaWAN Details**

The R72624 uses the LoRaWAN protocol which allows for long-range transmission with low power consumption. Compatibility with the LoRaWAN protocol depends on the specific region frequencies: IN865-867 for India, EU868 for Europe, US915 for the US, AU915 for Australia, KR920 for Korea, and AS923 for Asia.

R72624 uses Class A LoRaWAN which enables bi-directional communication between the device and the network server. It also supports Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) functionality.

**Power Consumption**

The R72624 sensor operates between 2.0 - 3.6V. The device is powered by a 1/2 AA lithium battery, offering a battery life of between 1 to 2 years, subject to the rate of data transmission.

**Use Cases**

The NETVOX - R72624 sensor fits perfectly in a variety of applications such as:

1. Industrial Monitoring: Monitoring humidity and temperature within manufacturing settings to ensure the right conditions for product quality and machinery. 

2. Greenhouse Farming: To ensure temperature and humidity in the greenhouse are at optimal levels for crop growth.

3. HVAC Systems: The sensor can be used to adjust and control the temperature and humidity in a space as part of an HVAC system.

4. Cold Chain Monitoring: They are ideal for the monitoring of medicine and food supplies during transit.

**Limitations**

While the NETVOX - R72624 sensor is an innovative device, it still has a few limitations:

1. Signal Range: Despite featuring the LoRaWAN capability, its range can be affected drastically by environmental factors, such as the presence of obstacles and building materials.

2. Dependency on LoRaWAN Gateways: The R72624 requires a LoRaWAN gateway within its range to function properly.

3. Non-Rechargeable Batteries: Its non-rechargeable batteries need to be replaced after depletion, increasing maintenance efforts.

4. Sensor Placement: Inaccurate readings can occur if the sensor is placed close to heat sources or in direct sunlight. The sensor location should be chosen carefully.

In conclusion, the NETVOX - R72624 sensor is ideal for environments that require detailed tracking of temperature and humidity levels. Despite its few limitations, its long battery life, low power consumption, and wide deployment capabilities make it suitable for a wide range of IoT applications.
