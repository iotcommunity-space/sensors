**NETVOX - Ra0716: Technical Overview**

**Working Principles**

NETVOX - Ra0716 is an IoT sensor intended for smart irrigation systems and agricultural monitoring, designed to accurately measure soil temperature and moisture levels. 

This sensor operates based on the thermistor principle for the temperature sensor and electrical resistance for the moisture sensor. The soil temperature is measured by comparing the resistance of the thermistor to the ambient temperature. Meanwhile, the soil moisture concentration is gauged by checking the variance in electrical resistance in the soil matrix.

**Installation Guide**

1. Pre-installation: Ensure the sensor is in a shutdown state.
2. Integration: Plug in both temperature and moisture probes in the sensor.
3. Insertion into Soil: Carefully place the sensor into the desired soil position, ensuring it is thoroughly inserted into the ground. 
4. Once inserted, switch on the sensor to let it start capturing data.
5. Ground Device Configuration: Pair the sensor with the system using the pre-set DevEUI and AppKey. The sensor is ready to send data to your network server.

**LoRaWAN Details**

NETVOX - Ra0716 incorporates Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LoRaWAN) technology, providing long-range transmission for rural or difficult-to-reach areas. The device uses the LoRaWAN protocol version 1.0.1. Also, it supports Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) and includes a set of predefined device profiles to simplify integration (including ABP and OTAA).

**Power Consumption**

The sensor uses a 2600 mAh / 3.6 V Lithium battery with a lifecycle of up to 10 years. However, the battery life can vary based on the frequency of data transmission, environmental conditions, and other factors.

**Use Cases**

1. Smart Agriculture: For managing irrigation, monitoring soil conditions, and optimizing crop production.
2. Gardening: For tracking soil conditions to enhance plant health.
3. Environment Monitoring: To observe and collect data about soil and environmental conditions over time.
4. Research: Ideal for scientific exploration and research in soil study fields.

**Limitations**

a) Environmental Limitations: The sensor might provide inaccurate data if exposed to extreme environmental conditions like excessive moisture, high-intensity sunlight, or very low temperatures.

b) Battery Limitations: Once the battery is depleted, it must be replaced. The battery life depends on factors like data transmission frequency and environmental conditions.

c) Distance Limitations: While the sensor uses LoRaWAN offering extended range, obstacles such as buildings and other physical structures can reduce the signal strength.

d) Soil Type Limitations: Different soil types may affect the sensor's readings. Therefore, it's advised to calibrate the sensor according to the specific soil type for accurate measurements. 

e) Installation Limitations: Improper installation or placing the sensor superficially may affect the accuracy of the readings. Always make sure the device is well insulated.',
