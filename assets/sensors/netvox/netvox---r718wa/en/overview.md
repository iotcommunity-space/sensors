### Technical Overview for NETVOX - R718Wa

**Working Principles**

The NETVOX - R718Wa operates using resistive moisture detection principles. It is designed to measure soil moisture levels in the fields. The sensor measures the resistance between two metal plates in its probe, placed in the soil. This resistance is then converted into a moisture value, providing readings in percentages. With a sensing range of 0-100%, the sensor provides granular insights into the moisture levels of the field.

**Installation Guide**

1. Position the R718Wa device in the field you wish to monitor. It should be placed in soil at a depth that reflects your crop's root system width.
2. Connect the device to the configuration tool using the Micro USB port and set the correct LoRaWAN parameters.
3. Insert two ER14505 batteries into the battery holder.
4. The indicator LED will flash and the device will now join the network automatically.
5. The sensor starts to work when the connection to the LoRaWAN network is successful.

**LoRaWAN Details**

The R718Wa uses the LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) protocol for communication, operating in the ISM bands (frequency varies as per the region). It conforms to the LoRaWAN 1.0.2 protocol and supports both Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) and regular fixed data rates. 

**Power Consumption**

R718Wa operates on two 3.6V ER14505 AA Lithium batteries. The power consumption of the device is designed to be ultra-low, operating in the sleep mode most of the time and waking up only to transmit data or receive commands to ensure longevity.

**Use Cases**

The NETVOX - R718Wa is designed primarily for use in agriculture for monitoring soil moisture. It aids in strategic irrigation, ensuring the soil has optimum moisture, thus conserving water. Additionally, it can be used in environments where monitoring moisture is essential, such as greenhouses, vineyards, or golf courses.

**Limitations**

1. The R718Wa is a single-parameter sensor, so it can only measure soil moisture. It does not monitor other factors like soil pH, temperature, etc.
2. LoRaWAN coverage is essential for the device to work. If the area lacks coverage, the device will not transmit data to the network.
3. The accuracy may decrease when used in extremely saturated or dry soils. 
4. The device only works best within the temperature range of -20°C to 55°C and a relative humidity range of 10% to 90%, beyond which it could malfunction.
5. Though power consumption is low, occasional battery replacement is needed depending on reporting intervals. 

In summary, the NETVOX - R718Wa is a reliable and effective tool for soil moisture monitoring when used within its operating parameters and limitations.
