## Netvox R718N125 - Technical Overview

### I. Working Principles

The Netvox R718N125 is an IoT instrument engineered to provide real-time data on the temperature, humidity, and heat index in the environment where it is installed. This device uses an integrated temperature and humidity probe to gather data, and afterward, it sends these measurements to the specific LoRaWAN gateway.

### II. Installation Guide

The R718N125 is wall-mounted. Locate a suitable position where the environmental elements to be measured are most representative. Drill holes and fix the device on the wall using screws. The device should be installed in a dry and ventilated place, avoiding direct sunlight and rain. After installation, switch on the device and it should automatically start sending data to the linked LoRaWAN gateway.

### III. LoRaWAN Details

The R718N125 is compatible with a standard LoRaWAN 1.0.2 protocol, hence, it can be utilized with any gateway that supports this version of the protocol. The device is configured to use Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) by default, nevertheless, LoRaWAN configuration can be modified using the Netvox LoRaWAN configurator tool.

### IV. Power Consumption

Powered by 2 x ER14505 AA batteries, the R718N125 has an operational period of up to five years, but this will depend on the frequency of data transmissions. Power consumption will be greater when reporting is done at higher frequency and vice versa.

### V. Use Cases

Netvox R718N125 finds best application in various industries such as:
- Smart Agriculture: where precise humidity and temperature monitoring is critical.
- Industrial Monitoring and Control: to maintain ideal working conditions in the manufacturing processes.
- Building and Home Automation: for efficient and effective climate control.
- Greenhouse Management: to ensure optimal growth conditions for plants.

### VI. Limitations 

- Although the R718N125 supports a wide coverage area due to LoRaWAN, its coverage can be obstructed by physical objects such as metals and concrete walls.
- The Netvox R718N125 operates in a specific temperature range (-20°C to +55°C). Therefore, it may not provide accurate readings in environments that fall outside this range.
- The lifespan of the device's battery can be shorter if the reporting interval is reduced to less than the default setting.
- It requires a LoRaWAN gateway to forward its data, representing an additional cost for the users if they do not have an existing network infrastructure.

Conclusively, proper installation and setup are necessary for the excellent performance of Netvox R718N125. This device, when used in the appropriate usage scenario and well-maintained, will provide an effective solution for monitoring environmental conditions.
