## NETVOX - R72715 Sensor Documentation

### Technical Overview

The NETVOX R72715 is an advanced wireless Industrial IoT sensor that operates primarily on LoRaWAN technology. It is specifically designed to detect and measure vibration, temperature, and tilt movements in various operational environments. It is a robust industrial-grade device, offering real-time monitoring and ensuring efficiency and safety in different industrial applications.

### Working Principle

NETVOX R72715 does not function like typical IoT devices. It uses three operational modules for detection:

1. **Vibration Sensor**: The vibration sensor uses an accelerometer to detect and measure vibrations in devices or surfaces. The sensor transforms mechanical force into electrical signals and provides reliable data, thereby detecting anomalies and issuing alerts for preventive maintenance.

2. **Temperature Sensor**: It measures the heat intensity or coldness of the monitored device or environment and converts this into an electrical output that can be interpreted and used for system controls or alarms.

3. **Tilt Sensor**: It is designed to measure inclination in multiple axes to monitor and identify change in positions and angles.

### Installation Guide

Installation of NETVOX R72715 requires simple steps:

1. First, securely mount the device on the asset or machine that needs monitoring using screws or adhesive.
2. Turn the device on by pressing the on/off button located on the sensor.
3. Connect the sensor to the network. This is achieved by pressing the set button for 5 seconds until the LED blinks once.
4. Configure the LoRaWAN settings through a network server to connect to the sensor.

### LoRaWAN Details

The NETVOX R72715 utilizes LoRaWAN (Low Range Wide Area Network) Class A and C protocols for communication, offering low power, long range, and secure data transmission. It operates on different frequency ranges: EU433 and CN470 for Asia, EU868 for Europe, US902 for the United States, AS923 for Asia, AU915 for Australia, and KR920 for Korea.

### Power Consumption

The NETVOX R72715 is equipped with an 8000mAH ER18505 Lithium battery. It is designed for low power consumption, making it a suitable solution for long-term IoT applications. Depending on the usage, the battery can last up to 2 years or more.

### Use Cases

The NETVOX R72715 sensor finds applications in a variety of sectors:

1. **Industrial Automation**: It is used to detect any abnormal vibration, tilt, or temperature changes in machines for early fault detection and maintenance.
2. **Building Monitoring**: The sensor effectively monitors building structures' integrity by detecting vibrations and shifts.
3. **Logistics**: NETVOX R72715 can ensure the safe transportation of goods by monitoring vibrations and tilt during transit.

### Limitations

Despite its robustness, the NETVOX R72715 sensor has a few limitations:

1. The device works effectively in a temperature range from -20°C to +55°C. Beyond this range, it may not provide accurate readings or could suffer damage.
2. It requires a LoRaWAN gateway within its operating range for successful communication and data transmission. In areas lacking proper LoRaWAN coverage, its connectivity might be challenged.
3. While its battery can last up to a couple of years, it still requires periodic replacement, which can lead to downtime in monitoring.
4. The device does not have the capability to measure moisture or humidity, limiting its environmental monitoring scope.

Lastly, all device implementations should always consider legal compliance. The frequency range that the device operates under should be legally used in the country where the device is deployed.
