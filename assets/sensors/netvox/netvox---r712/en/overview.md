# Technical Overview of NETVOX - R712 

## Introduction
The NETVOX - R712 is a first-rate IoT environmental sensor that specializes in monitoring ambient light intensity. It adopts low-power consumption technology and transmits data to the gateway through the LoRaWAN wireless protocol. This guide reviews the operating principles, course of installation, LoRaWAN details, power utilization, use cases, and limitations of NETVOX - R712.

## Operating Principles 
The NETVOX - R712 works on the principle of detecting changes in ambient light intensity. The sensor measurements are then converted to digital signals. These digital signals are sent to the LoRaWAN gateway via radio frequencies, which are later decoded to be understood and utilized. The large data collection, that the IoT sensor collects, is accumulated, stored, and analyzed in the cloud server.

## Installation Guide
1. Placement: Select a strategic location with the required light conditions. Avoid placing near heat sources or high humidity areas.

2. Set-up: Unbox the NETVOX - R712 and install the batteries.

3. Activation: Activate the device by pressing the 'SET button'.

4. Network Connection: Link the LoRa Gateway with the NETVOX - R712 via the LoRaWAN wireless protocol.

5. Function Testing: After setting it up, it is necessary to check if the sensor is properly functioning.
