## NETVOX - R311G Sensor: Technical Overview

The NETVOX R311G sensor is a state-of-the-art, Internet of Things (IoT) enabled device from NETVOX designed to detect and wirelessly transmit data regarding the presence or absence of water to facilitate effective and efficient water management.

### 1. Working Principles

The R311G is outfitted with sensitive sensing probes that specifically detect water presence. When the sensor's probes touch water, it triggers a change in the adjoining electrical circuit's resistance, which the sensor then identifies and registers as the presence of water. This data is then wirelessly disseminated, in predefined intervals or immediately upon detection, via LoRaWAN technology.

### 2. Installation Guide

To install the NETVOX R311G sensor, you need to follow the prompt, easy-to-understand steps as described below:

- Unbox the R311G device and ensure all listed components are available.
- Place the device in the desired monitoring location, ensuring the adjacent probes touch the area where water will likely appear.
- Establish a connection by adding the device to your LoRaWAN network, which is done through the special coding assigned to each R311G sensor.
- Test the device to ensure it is operational, triggering it with water, and checking if an alert is sent.

### 3. LoRaWAN Details

LoRaWAN or Long Range Wide Area Network is the wireless data communication technology utilized by the R311G sensor. This protocol is industry-leading for IoT devices, allowing long-range communication of up to 15 kilometers in open field conditions, while minimizing power usage. Keep in mind that range decreases when signal obstacles, such as concrete or metal, are present.

### 4. Power Consumption

The R311G is battery-powered, utilizing two 3.0V CR2450 button batteries. One of the hallmarks of the NETVOX R311G sensor is its relatively low power usage, thanks to its intelligent power management system. The device goes into sleep mode when not transmitting data or if the sensor does not detect any water, significantly extending the battery life.

### 5. Use Cases

The NETVOX R311G sensor can be applied across several sectors and industries to monitor water presence:

- Residential: Monitor for leaks around plumbing fixtures, in walls, and basements.
- Commercial Estates: Detect leaks in large buildings to prevent extensive water damage.
- Agricultural: Determine the presence or absence of water in irrigation systems.
- Industrial: Detection of water in places it shouldn't be in factories or warehouses.
  
### 6. Limitations

While the NETVOX R311G sensor offers several benefits, it has its limitations:

- Dependence on LoRaWAN coverage: If your location lacks sufficient LoRaWAN coverage, the R311G device may not work to its fullest potential.
- Less effective in a high interference environment: Dense urban areas, or locations with a large number of obstructions like concrete or metal, may hamper signal range and performance.
- Not for active water depth measurement: The sensor is designed just to identify water presence or absence. It cannot quantify how much water is present or measure water depth. 

Despite these limitations, the NETVOX R311G sensor presents a robust water detection solution with low energy demands and the benefits of connected IoT technology, making it a valuable tool in a wide range of applications.
