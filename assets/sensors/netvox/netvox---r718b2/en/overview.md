# NETVOX - R718B2 (NETVOX) Technical Overview

## Working Principles

The NETVOX R718B2 is a wireless sensor that supports the LoRaWAN long-range wireless protocol. Primarily, this sensor measures temperature and humidity levels, and it is designed to operate within an indoor environment. Using semi-conductor sensors, the R718B2 continuously measures the changes in its surrounding temperature and humidity levels. This information is then relayed via LoRaWAN to a defined IoT network where it can be processed and analysed. 

## Installation Guide

Installing the NETVOX R718B2 is relatively straightforward as it is a wireless device. 

1. First, select an appropriate indoor location where temperature/humidity measurements need to be made.
2. Using the support bracket which comes with the device, screw it securely into the desired location.
3. Attach the NETVOX R718B2 onto the bracket, ensuring it fits properly.
4. Once installed, power on the device by pressing turns the power switch on the side of the device.
5. Configure the NETVOX R718B2 from your device management console or network server to ensure it is connected to your LoRaWAN network.

## LoRaWAN Details

The R718B2 operates on LoRaWAN Class A protocol, the most energy-efficient LoRaWAN class available. Its frequency bands are configurable in the range of CN470/EU433/KR920/US915/EU868/AS923/AU915. It supports adaptive data rate (ADR) capabilities and the LoRaWAN 1.0.3 protocol.

## Power Consumption

Being designed for low power consumption, the device operates on two 3.6V ER AA batteries, which provides it with a battery life of up to five years (use-dependent). This means that once installed, the device can operate continuously for long periods without the need for battery replacement.

## Use Cases

NETVOX R718B2 can be used in a wide variety of applications which require the constant monitoring of indoor temperature and humidity levels. These include but not limited to:

- Climate control in domestic settings 
- Industrial environment monitoring 
- Greenhouse monitoring systems 
- Smart office spaces 
- Data Centre monitoring 

## Limitations

The device has a measurement range limitation for temperature from -20 degrees Celsius to +55 degrees Celsius and for humidity from 0 to 100%. Also, the LoRaWAN range can be affected by building materials and large metal structures, as well as other radio frequency devices and barriers. The device's operation is strictly indoors, and it may not function optimally if it is placed outside or in highly moist areas due to lack of weather resistance.
