## NETVOX R718Db Technical Overview 

### 1. Working Principles
The NETVOX R718Db is a high precision IoT moisture sensor. It detects and sends changes in moisture levels to a designated remote server. Its operation relies on capacitive sensing principles where the sensor measures changes in moisture levels within a specific range. Once the sensor picks up these changes, it triggers a LoRaWAN transmission to the server.

Sensitive to both outreach and depth, the NETVOX R718Db measures soil moisture at various depths, enabling users to gain a precise understanding of the soil water content. The probe capacities change as per the water content in the soil, the data is then converted into respective electrical signals that are further processed to give a relative representation of soil moisture.

### 2. Installation Guide
Installation of the NETVOX R718Db is straightforward. The sensor is to be pushed directly into the ground or soil keeping the object straight and ensuring no obstruction hampers the probes. It is recommended to install the sensor in a vertical position to keep it more receptive to moisture gradients. Take care to prevent any damage to the probe during installation.

### 3. LoRaWAN Details
The NETVOX R718Db operates on the LoRaWAN protocol and supports multiple LoRaWAN frequency bands. It can be configured and integrated with any network server supporting LoRaWAN like Au915-928, AS923, EU868, etc. The sensor supports adaptive data rate (ADR) and is powered by LoRaWAN 1.0.2 protocol. 

### 4. Power Consumption
Deliberately designed with lower power consumption, the NETVOX R718Db works on a 12000mAh ER34615 battery. Depending on the frequency of transmissions and data rates, the battery can last up to several years, making it an efficient choice for long-term remote deployments.

### 5. Use Cases
The NETVOX R718Db is primarily used in agriculture, horticulture, and environmental studies to determine soil's moisture levels. It is an invaluable tool for farmers and researchers alike in achieving optimal water consumption levels and understanding the water needs of specific crops, thereby improving irrigation efficiency and sustainable management of water.

### 6. Limitations
While the NETVOX R718Db is a sophisticated device, it has a few limitations:

   - Although it is water-resistant, it cannot be permanently underwater.
   - It doesn't provide a real-time constant reading but transmits data at regular intervals.
   - The signal strength and area covered might be limited based on environmental factors.
   - The device needs a LoRaWan gateway within its range to send data effectively.

Despite these limitations, the NETVOX R718Db still offers high-performance operation in soil moisture detection and is a worthy addition to agricultural and environmental IoT applications.
