Technical Overview for NETVOX - R718Ka (NETVOX)

1. Working Principles:
   The NETVOX - R718Ka is a wireless device based on the IoT (Internet of Things) technology. It uses LoRa (Long Range) Technology to provide low-power and long range wireless communication. The device includes a built-in infrared human body sensor and temperature/humidity sensor. The information collected by the sensor would be sent out by radio waves through LoRaWAN protocols to a designated server, where the user can access and monitor the data in real-time.

2. Installation Guide:
   a. Position the R718Ka in the desired location, ensuring an optimal path for data communication. Make sure it is placed in a range covering your LoRaWAN gateway. 
   b. Install the NETVOX sensors application.
   c. Pair the R718Ka with your NETVOX application and select its specific operating function. The user can set the device details, security keys, and data rate according to the specific deployment requirements.
   d. Once the device configuration is complete, R718Ka will start collecting and transmitting data to the server via the LoRaWAN gateway.
  
3. LoRaWAN Details:
   LoRaWAN is a media access control (MAC) protocol for wide area networks. It is designed to allow low-powered IoT devices to communicate with Internet-connected applications over long-range wireless connections. For R718Ka, the operating frequency range can be selected in the LoRaWAN protocol depending on the region â€“ AS923, AU915, EU868, or US915.

4. Power Consumption:
   NETVOX - R718Ka is a low-power consumption device. It operates on two 3.6 V ER14505 AA Lithium batteries. Based on the default transmitting power (14dBm) and data rate (SF=10), the battery life can be up to 5 years if 140 messages are sent daily. 

5. Use Cases:
   Given its functionality, NETVOX - R718Ka is ideal for various scenarios like smart homes, hospitals, retail stores, and warehouses. It can detect human movement and monitor temperature and humidity, making it suitable for energy management, predictive maintenance, and safety applications.

6. Limitations:
   a. Communication Range: The communication range might vary depending on the actual environment and the gateway placement.
   b. Battery Dependency: The device works on batteries and hence frequent changing may be required depending on the usage.
   c. Environmental Impact: Extreme conditions can affect the device functionality, especially the temperature and humidity sensors.
   
Note: NETVOX - R718Ka needs to be paired with LoRaWAN gateway(s) and requires a network server to access the collected data which might result in additional cost and technical knowledge.
