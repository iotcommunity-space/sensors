# Technical Overview for NETVOX - R718N125

The NETVOX R718N125 is a LoRaWAN-enabled sensor designed to offer a robust solution for detecting shock and vibration events in various applications. Utilizing its built-in accelerometer, this device effectively measures shock and vibration levels, making it suitable for a wide range of industrial and commercial use cases.

## Working Principles

The R718N125 operates on the principle of detecting changes in acceleration using a built-in accelerometer. This sensor measures the acceleration forces that cause movement, which are then translated into shock or vibration data. Once the device captures the data, it is transmitted via the LoRaWAN network to a central server for analysis and action. The primary function of this device is not continuous monitoring, but rather event-driven reporting, triggered by sudden movements exceeding a predefined threshold.

## Installation Guide

1. **Unboxing and Inspection:**
   - Upon receiving the R718N125, inspect the device for any visible damages.
   - Verify that all components, including the primary sensor unit and complementary mounting hardware, are included in the package.

2. **Battery Installation:**
   - Open the device casing by gently unscrewing or unclipping the enclosure.
   - Insert the 3.6V lithium battery, ensuring correct polarity.
   - Secure the casing by closing it back, ensuring it is tightly sealed to maintain the device's IP65 rating.

3. **Device Mounting:**
   - Identify an optimal mounting location where the sensor can accurately detect shock or vibrations.
   - Use the provided mounting brackets or screws to secure the sensor in place. Ensure that the mounting surface is stable to avoid false readings.

4. **Network Configuration:**
   - Turn on the device by pressing the power button or, if available, using the accompanying magnet key for models with magnetic activation.
   - Follow the manufacturerâ€™s instructions to configure LoRaWAN settings, including DevEUI, AppEUI, and AppKey, through the provided communication interface (e.g., USB/OTAA/ABP).

5. **Testing:**
   - Trigger the sensor manually to ensure it is adequately sending data to the LoRaWAN network. This can be done by subjecting the sensor to a controlled shock or vibration while monitoring the data reception on the server.
   
## LoRaWAN Details

- **Frequency Bands:** The R718N125 supports several frequency bands depending on regional regulations: EU868, US915, AU915, AS923, etc.
- **Communication Protocol:** The device communicates through LoRaWAN Class A. This ensures low power consumption and efficient data transmission.
- **Data Rate:** Utilizes adaptive data rate (ADR) to maximize network efficiency and battery life.
- **Security:** Employs AES-128 encryption to secure data communications over the LoRaWAN network.

## Power Consumption

- Equipped with a 3.6V 8500mAh lithium battery, the R718N125 is optimized for low power consumption.
- Battery life can vary significantly depending on transmission frequency and environmental conditions but typically ranges between 5 to 10 years given normal operational use.
- The device consumes more power during transmission; hence, minimizing transmission frequency can extend the overall battery life.

## Use Cases

1. **Industrial Monitoring:**
   - Ideal for monitoring machinery and equipment for unexpected shocks or vibrations that may indicate potential maintenance issues.

2. **Asset Protection:**
   - Used in warehouses or during the transportation of goods to detect and report potentially damaging impacts or conditions.

3. **Structural Health Monitoring:**
   - Employed in the construction industry to monitor infrastructure integrity by detecting vibrations or shifts in structure.

4. **Smart City Applications:**
   - Installed in critical infrastructure to provide early warnings for events such as structural impacts or seismic activity.

## Limitations

- **Limited Continuous Monitoring Capabiltity:** The R718N125 is primarily designed for event-driven reporting rather than continuous data logging.
- **Transmission Range:** LoRaWAN range can vary greatly depending on environmental factors and obstacles; ensuring a clear line of sight or minimal physical obstructions is ideal for maximizing communication range.
- **Latency:** As a Class A device, it may experience some latency in data transmission depending on network conditions and scheduling.
- **Environmental Constraints:** While the device is IP65 rated, extremely harsh or corrosive environments may impact its longevity or performance over time.

The NETVOX R718N125 is a versatile sensor that provides actionable insights through its shock and vibration detection capabilities, enabling users to maintain efficiency, safety, and proactive asset management in a variety of industries.
