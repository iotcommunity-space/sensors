# Netvox - R311A Technical Overview

## Working Principles

The Netvox - R311A, herein termed as R311A, is an intelligent door/window sensor. Leveraging the Internet of Things (IoT) technology, R311A discerns whether a door or window is opened or closed. The sensor employs a magnetism sensing technology which detects changes in the magnetic field when a door or window is manipulated and transmits these alterations to the user's device/portal ensuring maximum security.

## Installation Guide

Installation of R311A is user-friendly and can be accomplished in a few steps:

1. Position the main body of the R311A sensor on the frame of the door/window, while placing the magnet unit on the moving part, ensuring they align precisely when the door/window closes.

2. Fasten the units physically using either the threaded holes on the back of the sensor for screws or adhesive tape. The clearance between main sensor and the magnet unit when closed should be less than 20mm.

3. Once secured, use a screwdriver to remove the battery insulation sheet and initiate the sensor.

4. The sensor will connect automatically to an established LoRaWAN network, given that you preconfigured it with the necessary security and access credentials.

## LoRaWAN Details

The R311A sensor operates on the LoRaWAN protocol ensuring long-range, low-power wireless transmission of data. It can be utilized in different frequencies according to the regulations in different regions – AS923, AU915, EU868, or US915. The sensor supports adaptive data rate (ADR) and is compatible with Class A and Class C LoRaWAN devices.

## Power Consumption

The R311A door/window sensor possesses a long battery life attributed to its low power consumption. It is powered by 2 replaceable 3.0V/1200mAh ER14250 batteries. Even at a 30-minute reporting interval, the batteries can operate for up to several years, ensuring a low maintenance experience.

## Use Cases

The R311A sensor is suitable for a variety of smart home, workplace and commercial applications including:

1. Residential and Commercial Security: It can be employed in homes, offices, warehouses, and any buildings with entry points susceptible to unauthorized access.

2. Energy Efficiency: By detecting window/door status, it can contribute to the control of heating or cooling systems, optimizing energy consumption.

3. Asset Management: It can be applied in server rooms, medicine closets, or any restricted access areas that contain sensitive/crucial items.

## Limitations

1. Distance Limitation: R311A operates in LoRaWAN’s range; therefore, its efficiency might be reduced in areas with a weak network or substantial obstructions.

2. Not waterproof: The R311A sensor is not waterproof and therefore cannot be installed in areas prone to high moisture or direct water exposure.

3. Limited status detection: The sensor can only detect whether a door or window is open or closed. It may not correctly indicate partially open states or forcible break-ins that do not move the door or window.

That concludes the overview of Netvox - R311A. Please ensure you read and understand the user manual thoroughly before the installation and operation to achieve optimal performance.
