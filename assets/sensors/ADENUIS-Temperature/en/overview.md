### Working Principles

The ADENUIS - Temperature Sensor operates based on the principle of thermoresistance, where its semiconductor-based sensing element detects temperature variations. These changes in temperature cause variations in electrical resistance, which are then converted into accurate temperature readings. The sensor is calibrated to offer high precision over a wide ambient temperature range.

Internally, it features a microcontroller that processes the raw data from the thermoresistor. This processed data is then transmitted via LoRaWAN communication, which is well-suited for long-range and low-power applications, ensuring sustainable and remote temperature monitoring.
