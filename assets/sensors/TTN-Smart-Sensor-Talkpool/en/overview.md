## Working Principles

The TTN Smart Sensor operates using a combination of sensing elements each dedicated to capturing specific environmental data:

- **Temperature and Humidity Sensors**: The device uses advanced digital sensors with high precision to measure ambient temperature and humidity. These sensors offer fast response times, stability, and minimal drift characteristics, ensuring reliable long-term readings.

- **Air Quality Sensors**: The sensor is equipped with an air quality sensor that typically measures parameters like volatile organic compounds (VOCs) or particulate matter (PM). These sensors rely on electrochemical, optical, or semiconductor methods to evaluate air quality.

Data collected by the sensors is processed onboard and transmitted via LoRaWAN, a low-power, wide-area network protocol renowned for its backend efficiency and wide coverage.

## Installation Guide

1. **Site Selection**: Choose a location where the sensor's readings will be representative of the area of interest. Avoid direct exposure to water and extreme weather to prolong the lifespan of the device.

2. **Mounting**: Use the mounting kit provided with the sensor to securely attach the device at the chosen location. Ensure the sensor orientation (if specified) is aligned according to the installation guide for optimal performance.

3. **Powering Up**: The TTN Smart Sensor usually comes with a built-in battery. Activate the battery according to the manual, often involving the removal of an insulator tab or actuator switch.

4. **Configuration**: Depending on the version, configuration might be via a smartphone app or PC software to set parameters like measurement intervals and network credentials.

5. **Network Integration**: Ensure the sensor is in range of a LoRaWAN gateway. Follow the documentation to register the device with a LoRaWAN Network Server (TTN in this case). This involves entering the Device EUI, Application EUI, and App Key.

6. **Verification**: Verify successful data transmission to TTN by checking for updates in data packets within the network server or using a dashboard application.

## Limitations

- **Range Limitations**: Despite LoRaWAN's extended range capabilities, urban environments might cause signal attenuation due to dense structures.
  
- **Bandwidth Constraints**: Limited by the LoRaWAN duty cycle restrictions, making the application unsuitable for high-bandwidth requirement real-time monitoring scenarios.

- **Environment Sensitivity**: Extreme environmental conditions might affect sensor calibration, requiring periodic maintenance checks.

- **Single Sensor Configuration**: Specific environmental conditions like particulate sizes can affect air quality readings if the sensor's configuration does not match the pollutants' characteristics.
