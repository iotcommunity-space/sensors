## Technical Overview: DECENTLAB DL-MES5

The DECENTLAB DL-MES5 is a sophisticated environmental monitoring sensor specifically designed for precise measurement of methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), and non-methane hydrocarbons in the atmosphere. It utilizes advanced infrared sensor technology coupled with a robust wireless communication interface that leverages the Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) protocol for efficient data transmission across extended distances with minimal power consumption.

### Working Principles

The DL-MES5 operates on the basis of Non-Dispersive Infrared (NDIR) absorption spectroscopy. This method involves the detection of specific gases by measuring the absorption of infrared light, a characteristic directly proportional to the concentration of gases in the sample. The sensor is equipped with a highly stable optical component that ensures accurate readings over a wide range of concentrations. The sensor electronics convert the optical signals into digital data, which is then processed and transmitted via LoRaWAN.

### Installation Guide

**1. Site Selection:**
   - Choose a location with minimal obstructions and interference for optimal signal transmission.
   - Ensure the installation site is representative of the monitoring area.

**2. Mounting:**
   - Use suitable brackets or mounts to secure the sensor enclosure.
   - Ensure the sensor is mounted at a stable position and oriented correctly according to the installation guide provided by DECENTLAB.

**3. Calibration:**
   - Perform calibration as per DECENTLABâ€™s guidelines using calibration gases or in-situ calibration procedures.
   - Ensure proper sealing of calibration interfaces post-calibration to prevent environmental ingress.

**4. Power Supply:**
   - Insert the supplied lithium-thionyl chloride battery correctly while ensuring secure connections.
   - Test the power system by initiating a start-up cycle and verifying LED indications.

**5. LoRaWAN Configuration:**
   - Configure the device credentials (DevEUI, AppEUI, AppKey) for network association.
   - Use the DECENTLAB configuration tool or web interface to set parameters.

**6. Testing and Commissioning:**
   - Perform a communication test to confirm successful data transmission.
   - Verify sensor functionality by comparing readings with a handheld instrument, if possible.
