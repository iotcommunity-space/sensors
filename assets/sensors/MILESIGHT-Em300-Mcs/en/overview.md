   The sensor uses a highly accurate digital temperature and humidity sensor. The data is collected in real-time and can indicate conditions like indoor climate control or environmental changes in industrial settings.

2. **Magnetic Contact Switch:**
   This feature uses a magnetic field sensor to detect the opening and closing of doors or windows. It operates by measuring changes in the magnetic field when the magnet is removed or aligned.

3. **Data Transmission:**
   Sensor data is transmitted over the LoRaWAN network to a centralized application server, enabling real-time monitoring and data analysis.

## Installation Guide

1. **Site Selection:**
   - Select a location where environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and movement need to be monitored.
   - Ensure the area has LoRaWAN network coverage for effective data transmission.

2. **Sensor Placement:**
   - For temperature and humidity monitoring, affix the sensor away from direct sunlight or potential water ingress.
   - For magnetic contact monitoring, align the sensorâ€™s magnetic switch segment with the corresponding door or window magnetic counterpart.

3. **Mounting:**
   - Use the adhesive backing or screw mounts provided to attach the sensor securely.
   - Ensure the sensor is placed in a position where physical damage or tampering is minimized.
