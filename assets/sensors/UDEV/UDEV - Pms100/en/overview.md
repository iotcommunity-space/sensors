## Technical Overview of UDEV - Pms100 (UDEV) Sensor Module

The UDEV - Pms100 (UDEV) is a sophisticated particulate matter sensor designed for monitoring air quality by detecting airborne particles. Itâ€™s optimized for integration within a LoRaWAN network, making it ideal for remote environmental monitoring applications. Below are the technical aspects of Pms100, covering its working principles, installation, LoRaWAN details, power consumption, use cases, and limitations.

### Working Principles

The Pms100 utilizes laser scattering technology to measure particle concentration in the air. It employs a laser source to illuminate particulate matter, and the scattered light is detected by a photodetector. The intensity of the scattered light is proportional to the particle concentration. The sensor can detect particles with diameters ranging from 0.3 to 10 micrometers, providing data in terms of PM1.0, PM2.5, and PM10 levels.

### Installation Guide

1. **Site Selection**: 
   - Choose a location with adequate airflow.
   - Avoid obstructions like walls or trees that might affect air sampling.

2. **Mounting**:
   - Use the provided mounting bracket for secure installation.
   - Ensure the sensor is protected from direct rain and extreme heat using an enclosure if necessary.

3. **Power Connection**: 
   - Connect to a stable power supply (standard 5V DC input).
   - Ensure polarity is correct to avoid damage.

4. **Calibration**:
   - The sensor comes pre-calibrated but should be verified after installation. Allow stabilization time of at least 30 minutes.
   
5. **Network Integration**:
   - Configure LoRaWAN settings (frequency, data rate, etc.) as per network requirements.
   - Ensure connectivity to the local LoRa gateway.

### LoRaWAN Details

- **Frequency Bands**: Supports EU868, US915, AU915, and AS923 bands.
- **Data Rate**: Configurable per regional standards; typically utilizes DR0 to DR5.
- **Transmission Power**: Up to 14 dBm, adjustable.
- **Network Joining**: Supports both OTAA and ABP for secure authentication.
- **Channels**: Can utilize multiple channels for transmission, ensuring robust connectivity.

### Power Consumption

- **Active Mode**: Approximately 1W during active sensing and transmission.
- **Sleep Mode**: Maintains a minimal power state at approximately 0.1W.
- **Power Source**: Typically powered by a 5V DC adapter; options for solar panel integration are available for off-grid applications.

### Use Cases

- **Urban Air Quality Monitoring**: Deploy in cities for continuous PM measurement to inform public health advisories.
- **Industrial Site Monitoring**: Track emission levels in factories and plants to ensure compliance with regulatory standards.
- **Agricultural Applications**: Monitor air quality to study the impact of particulate pollution on crop health.
- **Smart City Solutions**: Integrate into smart city infrastructure for real-time air quality data analytics.

### Limitations

- **Environmental Limits**: Performance may degrade in extreme weather conditions (e.g., high humidity and dust storms).
- **Interference**: Electrical interference from nearby equipment can affect accuracy; separation is recommended.
- **Calibration Drift**: Periodic recalibration recommended to maintain accuracy over time.
- **Power Dependency**: Requires a constant power source; backup solutions are suggested to prevent data loss.

The UDEV - Pms100 (UDEV) stands as a versatile solution for a wide range of air quality monitoring needs, with its integration capabilities enabling ease of deployment in varied use scenarios. However, users must account for environmental and logistical factors during setup to maximize performance and reliability.
