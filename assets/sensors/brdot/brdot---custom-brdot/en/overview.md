## BRDOT - Custom Brdot (BRDOT) Technical Overview

### Working Principle
The BRDOT - Custom BRDOT (BRDOT) is an Internet of Things (IoT) sensor that utilizes LoRaWAN technology to transmit data collected from the monitored environment to the relevant user. Powered by its inbuilt or external power sources, it is equipped with various sensors that can accurately monitor physical or environmental conditions like temperature, humidity, light, vibration, etc. After the sensors gather the data, it's processed and conveyed to the LoRaWAN gateway, which in turn sends information to the end-user, typically via a server or cloud service.

### Installation Guide
1. Identify and prepare the installation site. The BRDOT should be placed in a location that its sensors can pick up accurate readings.
2. If the power source is external, connect it to the device using the provided cable. If it uses an internal battery, ensure that it's sufficiently charged.
3. Connect the device to your LoRaWAN network by configuring it using the provided software on your computer.
4. After connecting, place the device in your preferred location and use the software to set your preferred parameters and triggers.
5. Test the device to verify it's working correctly and it’s ready to monitor and send data to your network.

### LoRaWAN Details
BRDOT takes advantage of LoRaWAN's (Long Range Wide Area Network) long-range, low-power wireless capability to send sensor data to the gateway. Offering robust communication in urban and suburban regions, it can function in a range of up to 15 kilometers. With adaptive data rates and advanced ALOHA protocol, it ensures optimal power management and capacity usage.

### Power Consumption
The power consumption characteristics of the BRDOT sensor device depend primarily on its operational activities and the power efficiency of its components. The device is engineered for low power consumption, extending the lifespan of its power source whether it's battery-powered or draws power from an external source.

### Use Cases
The BRDOT sensor finds versatile applications in various sectors, including:

1. **Agricultural Sector**: Farmers use it to monitor soil conditions, air quality, crop health, etc., helping to improve yield and streamline operations.
2. **Smart Cities**: BRDOT is used in monitoring environmental conditions, street lighting, waste management, and public utilities.
3. **Industrial Monitoring**: It's deployed in factories for machine health monitoring, indoor air quality monitoring, and safety parameters.

### Limitations
Despite its advantages, the BRDOT device has some limitations:

1. **Dependency on LoRaWAN network coverage**: The device's capacity to transmit data as expected depends on the availability of LoRaWAN network coverage in its location.
2. **Environmental Factors**: Certain environmental conditions may affect the sensor’s accuracy and the device's transmission abilities.
3. **Limited data rate**: Though LoRaWAN facilitates long-range communication, its data rate is limited, which may restrict the amount of data that can be transmitted at once.
4. **Compliance**: In certain regions, regulatory compliance issues may limit the frequency and power output of the wireless transmission.
