# YUDASH - Https (YUDASH) Technical Overview

The YUDASH is a sophisticated IoT sensor designed for environmental and industrial monitoring, leveraging the capabilities of LoRaWAN for long-range wireless communication. This overview provides insights into the device's working principles, installation guide, LoRaWAN integration, power management, possible use cases, and limitations.

## Working Principles

YUDASH employs a collection of sensors to measure environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, air quality, and pressure. These sensors convert physical quantities into digital signals. The device is equipped with analog-to-digital converters and microcontrollers that process these signals before transmitting the data via LoRaWAN.

Every YUDASH unit acts as a node in a LoRaWAN network, sending data to a central gateway. The data is encrypted using HTTPS protocols, ensuring secure transmissions over the network to the cloud server or directly to end-user applications.

## Installation Guide

### Step 1: Pre-Installation Checks
- Ensure compatibility with your LoRaWAN network infrastructure.
- Verify that you have a LoRaWAN gateway within range to maximize connectivity.

### Step 2: Hardware Setup
- Position the YUDASH in a location with unobstructed exposure to the area you intend to monitor.
- Utilize mounting brackets or adhesive pads provided in the package for physical installation.
- Connect external power if using mains supply, or insert batteries if deploying in standalone mode.

### Step 3: Configuration
- Power on the device and connect to the YUDASH setup portal via the provided USB or Bluetooth link.
- Configure network settings, including the EUIs, App Keys, and network credentials for LoRaWAN access.
- Set up data transmission intervals based on your monitoring needs.

### Step 4: Activation
- Test the device to ensure it is pairing successfully with the LoRaWAN gateway.
- Monitor initial data transmission to determine all sensors are functioning as expected.
