# Technical Overview: KHOMP - ITS 402

## Introduction

The KHOMP ITS 402 is a sophisticated industrial IoT sensor designed for reliable and efficient data collection in smart environmental monitoring. It integrates various sensing technologies to measure parameters such as temperature, humidity, and other environmental factors. The sensor is engineered to communicate via the LoRaWAN protocol, ensuring low-power, long-range wireless transmission of data.

## Working Principles

The KHOMP ITS 402 operates on the principle of distributed sensing, equipped with specialized modules for detecting environmental conditions. The sensor utilizes:

- **Temperature Sensors:** Employing thermistors or digital temperature sensors to detect ambient temperature with high precision.
- **Humidity Sensors:** Typically capacitive humidity sensing elements are used for accurate relative humidity measurement.
- **Integrated Circuitry:** Ensures proper analog-to-digital conversion and data processing before transmission.

The sensor captures periodic readings as per user-defined intervals and transmits this data wirelessly to gateways for aggregation and analysis.
