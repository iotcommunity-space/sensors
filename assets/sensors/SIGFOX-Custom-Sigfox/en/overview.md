### Technical Overview: SIGFOX - Custom Sigfox

#### Introduction
SIGFOX is an ultra-narrowband technology designed for long-range and low-power communication in IoT applications. It is known for its simplicity and energy efficiency, catering to the transmission of small amounts of data over long distances. Custom Sigfox solutions are tailored to meet specific use cases beyond regular applications, providing a more bespoke deployment for unique project requirements.

#### Working Principles
SIGFOX operates on Ultra Narrow Band (UNB) technology, which allows for efficient communication by sending data packets over narrow spectrum channels. It utilizes the ISM band, specifically between 868 MHz and 902 MHz depending on the region, and supports up to 200 kb of data per day per device. The protocol is designed to provide connectivity by sending small messages (up to 12 bytes) to a base station, which then forwards them to the SIGFOX cloud for processing.

- **Simplex Communication**: SIGFOX primarily supports unidirectional communication from the device to the network (uplink), with limited downlink capabilities.
- **Energy Efficiency**: Due to infrequent and short transmissions, SIGFOX devices benefit from extended battery life, often lasting several years without requiring battery replacement.
- **Global Coverage**: Leveraging existing radio space, SIGFOX provides global connectivity, supported by a dense network of base stations.

#### Installation Guide
1. **Device Selection**: Choose appropriate SIGFOX hardware based on environmental conditions and data requirements. Ensure the device is SIGFOX-certified for compliance and reliability.
2. **Network Subscription**: Acquire a network subscription from SIGFOX to gain access to their global network and management platform.
3. **Positioning and Connectivity**: Install devices in optimal locations for signal reception, generally in elevated and unobstructed areas to maximize connectivity.
4. **Configuration**: Use the SIGFOX backend or relevant third-party platforms to configure devices, set endpoints, and manage subscriptions.
5. **Power Supply**: Properly connect batteries or verify existing ones, as devices often rely on battery power for long-term operation.

#### LoRaWAN Details
SIGFOX and LoRaWAN are often compared due to their shared IoT connectivity niche. Unlike LoRaWAN, SIGFOX is a fully managed service requiring no network infrastructure management from end users.

- **Comparison**:
  - **Network Type**: SIGFOX is a public network; LoRaWAN supports both public and private deployments.
  - **Payload Capacity**: SIGFOX supports smaller payloads, while LoRaWAN can handle larger packet transmissions.
  - **Bidirectionality**: LoRaWAN supports full bidirectional communication, whereas SIGFOX primarily focuses on uplink.
  - **Flexibility**: LoRaWAN offers greater flexibility for creating private networks.

#### Power Consumption
SIGFOX is renowned for its minimal power consumption. The technology is optimized for low-energy usage, with devices typically operating in sleep mode until data transmission is necessary. This characteristic allows for battery life extending up to several years for standard operations, making it ideal for remote or hard-to-access installations where frequent battery changes would be impractical.

#### Use Cases
SIGFOX is suited for applications requiring low data rates, low power, and long-range communication. Notable use cases include:

- **Smart Metering**: Efficiently transmit small packets of consumption data over long distances.
- **Asset Tracking**: Monitor location and status of assets in logistics without frequent data updates.
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Deploy sensors in remote areas to collect data on weather, pollution, or soil conditions.

#### Limitations
Despite its advantages, SIGFOX has certain limitations:

- **Data Throughput**: Limited to small packets and low data rates, making it unsuitable for applications requiring substantial data transfers.
- **Bidirectional Communications**: Primarily supports uplink with limited downlink capabilities.
- **Device Density**: High device density in a small area may affect communication reliability due to interference and network congestion.
- **Network Dependency**: Reliance on the existing SIGFOX infrastructure limits usage in areas without established coverage.

By understanding these principles, potential applications, and constraints, users can effectively deploy SIGFOX in tailored IoT solutions, leveraging its specific strengths to overcome logistical challenges in long-range low-power contexts.
