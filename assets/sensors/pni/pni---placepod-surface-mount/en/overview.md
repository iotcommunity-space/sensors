# PNI Placepod Surface Mount Sensor Overview

## Working Principles:
The PNI Placepod Surface Mount is an Internet of Things (IoT) enabled smart-parking sensor, designed to detect and report parking space occupancy changes in real-time. It leverages PNI Sensor Corporation's highly-precise geomagnetic sensor technology fused with proprietary algorithms and software. 

Upon installation, the sensor performs initial calibration to characterize its environment and set a baseline "empty" status. Any changes due to the presence or absence of a vehicle are reported by the sensor, which employs advanced algorithms to ignore extraneous magnetic disturbances such as those caused by passing vehicles or nearby objects.

## Installation Guide:
To install the PNI Placepod Surface Mount sensor, position it on the surface of the parking slot with adhesive or screws provided. Ensure the clear side is facing up and double-check that the device is leveled for accurate operation. It connects to a LoRaWAN gateway, thus installation should consider optimal network coverage. Once installed, use the PNI PlacePod Setup Application to complete the configuration of the device to your server. 

## LoRaWAN Details:
PNI Placepod Surface Mount sensor uses LoRa Wireless Communication (Long Range), a Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) protocol designed explicitly for low cost, low-power IoT applications. It supports LoRaWAN Class A, providing bi-directional communication with confirmed and unconfirmed message delivery capabilities. Support frequencies include EU868 and US902-928 bands. Ensure to match the deviceâ€™s frequency band with your region requirement.

## Power Consumption:
With its advanced low power design, the PNI Placepod Surface Mount provides up to 10 years of battery life, under typical use conditions. Furthermore, it employs a sophisticated power management system which optimizes power use to ensure extended operational life, making it an efficient solution for smart city applications.

## Use Cases:
The PNI Placepod Surface Mount sensor is primarily used for smart parking solutions, providing accurate, real-time data for parking management in cities, campuses, and corporate parking lots. Its data can be integrated into apps to direct drivers to available parking spaces, reducing congestion and pollution. It can also be used for traffic flow analysis and planning, law enforcement, and customer service in commercial venues.

## Limitations:
While the PNI Placepod is a robust and efficient parking sensor solution, it is essential to consider some limitations. Its performance might be slightly affected in areas with high magnetic interference or under extreme temperature conditions. Also, since it's dependant on LoRaWAN connectivity, regions with poor network coverage might experience data reporting delays. Lastly, there could be a slight margin of error in occupancy detection caused by small vehicles or certain types of vehicles with lower magnetic profiles.
