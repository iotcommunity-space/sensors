## DUODIGIT - Sx (DUODIGIT)

### Technology Overview
 
DUODIGIT - Sx (DUODIGIT) is a sensor-infused, technology-rich Internet of Things (IoT) device. Its implementation captures the essence of smart technology, facilitating effective data collection and transmission via a low power wide area network system, known as LoRaWAN.

### Working Principles

At its core, DUODIGIT uses multiple sensing elements to gather various types of information. Depending upon the model, these can range from temperature readings to soil moisture and so on. The accuracy and frequency of these readings are defined by the specific model of DUODIGIT in use.

The data collected by the DUODIGIT are then formulated into readable packets, which are forwarded to the attached LoRaWAN module. This module is responsible for transferring the data to a LoRaWAN gateway through wireless communication. The gateway then forwards the collected data to a network server from where it can be accessed and analyzed. 

### Installation Guide

1. Remove the DUODIGIT-Sx from the packaging and ensure the provided installation kit is complete.
2. Mount the device at the desired location ensuring that sensor inlet/outlet is unobstructed.
3. Power on the device and wait for the LED indicator to signal its activation.
4. Connect the device to the LoRaWAN network following the network's specific configuration.
5. The device should now be collecting and transmitting data to the defined network.

### LoRaWAN Details
 
DUODIGIT-Sx utilizes the LoRaWAN protocol, ensuring long-range connectivity with several benefits of low power consumption. This is possible due to the employment of low data rate transmission technology which does not exert heavy power demands on the device.

### Power Consumption
 
Power consumption remains one of the standout features of the DUODIGIT - Sx, reinforcing its suitability for low energy use scenarios. The sensors employed draw minimal energy in their operation, leaving the majority of the deviceâ€™s power for data transmission. Its power efficiency ensures a longer operational span even on battery power.

### Use Cases

DUODIGIT - Sx has diverse applicability due to its versatile sensor configurations. It's optimally designed for sectors requiring remote monitoring and data collection such as Agriculture, Environment Monitoring, Smart Cities, and Industrial IoT, helping to optimize operations, increase efficiency and reduce costs.

### Limitations
 
Despite its sophisticated technology and multi-faceted use cases, DUODIGIT - Sx does have limitations:

1. Distance Limitation: Although LoRaWAN can extend to significant distances, the data transmission range can be affected by physical obstructions or extreme atmospheric conditions.
   
2. Data rate: As a trade-off for long-range and power efficiency, LoRaWAN has a low data rate, making it unsuitable for applications that require real-time data or high data throughput.

3. Dependence on Network Coverage: The device is dependent on LoRaWAN networks for transmission. Areas with poor or no coverage may limit the applicability of the device.
   
4. Potential for Sensor Limitation: Depending on the specific version of the DUODIGIT, some sensors might not be available, potentially limiting the scope of data collection.
