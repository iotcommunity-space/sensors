### Technical Overview of ELSYS ERS Desk Sensor

The ELSYS ERS Desk is a sophisticated IoT sensor explicitly designed for monitoring and optimizing desk occupancy in office environments. This LoRaWAN-compatible sensor provides critical data for space utilization analysis, heating and cooling optimization, and smart building management.

#### Working Principles

The ERS Desk sensor utilizes two primary technologies:

1. **Passive Infrared (PIR) Sensor:** This component detects motion to determine occupancy status. PIR sensors are reliable for identifying the presence of people based on their heat signature.

2. **Magnetometer:** This feature helps detect changes in magnetic fields, which can be used to monitor certain desk activities or presence.

The sensor periodically transmits data over LoRaWAN, a low power, wide-area networking protocol, to a central server or gateway. Users can access this data for real-time monitoring and analysis through a cloud-based dashboard.

#### Installation Guide

1. **Placement:** 
   - Position the sensor underneath the desk, ideally at the center for optimal coverage.
   - Ensure the sensor is mounted securely to prevent tampering or accidental removal.
   
2. **Mounting:**
   - Use the provided adhesive tape or screws to attach the sensor under the desk.
   - Make sure the sensor face is clear of obstructions and pointing towards the user's seating area.

3. **Configuration:**
   - Power On: Remove the activation tab or insert batteries if not pre-installed.
   - Connect: Using a LoRaWAN-compatible gateway, register the sensor using its unique Device EUI.
   - Calibrate: Follow instructions via the remote configuration tool to calibrate PIR sensitivity as per room dynamics and magnetometer alignment.

4. **Testing:**
   - Verify transmission by comparing occupancy detection against other known data sources or physical checks.

#### LoRaWAN Details

- **Frequency Bands:** Compatible with global ISM bands, including EU868, US915, AS923, and AU915.
- **Data Rate:** Operates within the predefined LoRaWAN data rates (DR0 to DR5).
- **Security:** Implements LoRaWAN 1.0.3 security protocols, including network and application-layer encryption.
- **Communication Range:** Typically up to 10 km in rural and 2 km in urban environments, depending on gateway coverage.

#### Power Consumption

The ERS Desk sensor is designed for low power consumption, contributing to an extended battery life:

- **Power Source:** Operates on two AA batteries.
- **Battery Life:** Approximately up to 10 years under optimal conditions due to motion-activated transmission and energy-efficient LoRaWAN connectivity.
- **Sleep Mode:** Conserves energy by entering sleep mode during periods of inactivity.

#### Use Cases

1. **Space Utilization Analysis:** Gather data on desk usage patterns to improve space allocation and redesign workspace layouts.
2. **Energy Management:** Connect with HVAC systems to optimize energy usage based on actual occupancy trends.
3. **Facility Management:** Automate maintenance tasks based on desk usage cycles, reducing unnecessary interventions.
4. **Hot Desking Management:** Streamline desk booking systems by providing accurate real-time occupancy data.

#### Limitations

- **Detection Limitations:** PIR technology may have difficulty detecting small or stationary movements, leading to potential false negatives.
- **Installation Constraints:** Requires careful positioning under desks for accurate detection, which might be challenging in cluttered or non-standard desk designs.
- **Magnetometer Sensitivity:** Needs careful calibration to avoid interference from other nearby electronic devices or magnetic fields.
- **Dependence on Gateway Infrastructure:** Requires a reliable LoRaWAN network setup and infrastructure for effective operation and data transmission.

In summary, the ELSYS ERS Desk sensor is a powerful tool for smart office environments, providing critical insights into occupancy patterns, but it must be deployed with attention to the mentioned limitations and operational requirements for optimal performance.
