### Technical Overview for DRAGINO - Cs01Lb

The DRAGINO Cs01Lb is a LoRaWAN CO2 Sensor designed to measure the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the air and transmit the data via LoRaWAN networks. It is tailored to use in environmental monitoring, smart agriculture, and building management systems, providing real-time data to aid in maintaining optimal air quality.

#### Working Principles

The Cs01Lb utilizes a non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) sensor technology to measure CO2 levels. The NDIR sensor works by passing infrared light through the air sample and measuring the absorption of light. CO2 molecules absorb infrared light at specific wavelengths, which allows the Cs01Lb to determine the concentration of CO2 in the environment accurately. The sensor is calibrated to ensure precise measurements, typically using known gas mixtures.

#### Installation Guide

1. **Unpacking and Preparation:**
   - Carefully remove the sensor from its packaging.
   - Inspect for any physical damages.
   - Charge the built-in battery if necessary.
   
2. **Placement:**
   - Choose a location with good air circulation for accurate readings.
   - Avoid direct exposure to sunlight or moisture.
   - Mount the sensor on a stable surface or wall.

3. **Activation:**
   - Turn on the device using the power switch.
   - Ensure it joins the LoRaWAN network by checking LED indicators or using a network server.
