It integrates a variety of different sensors (subject to customization) which are used for gathering environmental data. The sensor processes analog or digital signals and transmits data over the LoRaWAN network to a central server, where the data can be analyzed and used for decision-making.

#### Key Features:
- **LoRaWAN Connectivity**: Uses spread-spectrum modulation techniques to achieve significant communication range, often exceeding 10 kilometers in rural settings.
- **Integrated Sensors**: Can be configured to measure a range of parameters like temperature, humidity, and soil moisture.
- **Battery-Powered**: Operates on batteries for years without needing replacement, depending on configuration and usage.
- **Rugged Design**: Suitable for outdoor environments with an IP66 rating, ensuring resistance to dust and water ingress.

### Installation Guide
1. **Site Selection**: Choose a location that is free of obstructions and interference for optimal connectivity. Ensure the area allows for sensor parameter requirements, such as exposure to the elements for environmental monitoring.
   
2. **Physical Setup**:
   - Mount the sensor on a mast or pole using the provided mounting kits, ensuring it is securely fastened.
   - Align the sensor antenna vertically for better LoRa signal propagation.

3. **Power Up**:
   - Insert batteries into the sensor. Ensure they are properly installed and check the integrity of battery connections.

4. **Configuration**:
   - Use the manufacturer's configuration software or app to connect to the LSN50V2 D20.
   - Set up the LoRaWAN parameters including network key (NwkKey), application key (AppKey), and device address (DevAddr).
   - Configure sensor reporting intervals based on your needs and power strategy.

5. **Activation**: 
   - Join the sensor to the LoRaWAN network via Over-the-Air Activation (OTAA) or Activation by Personalization (ABP).

6. **Verification**:
   - Test the signal strength and integrity of the data transmission to ensure proper setup.
   - Verify data reception on the central server or dashboard.

### LoRaWAN Details
