## Working Principles
The LMDS200 operates using Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar technology. This method involves emitting a microwave frequency that reflects off objects in its range. By calculating the frequency difference between the emitted and received signals, the LMDS200 determines the distance to the object. This measurement principle is robust against environmental influences, making it ideal for harsh environments.

Key Features:
- **Measurement Range:** Up to 30 meters
- **Accuracy:** ±3 mm
- **FMCW Radar:** Ensures stable and precise distance measurement

## Installation Guide

### Pre-Installation Requirements
1. **Power Supply:** Ensure that the battery is fully charged.
2. **Network Configuration:** Confirm that your LoRaWAN gateway is configured and operational.
3. **Site Assessment:** Determine the mounting height and ensure an unobstructed measurement path.

### Installation Steps
1. **Select a Location:** Choose a location where the sensor can directly face the target surface without obstructions.
2. **Mounting:** Use mounting brackets to secure the sensor to a stable surface. Ensure that it is fixed firmly to minimize vibrations.
3. **Calibration:** Power on the device and access its calibration settings as per the user manual. This step will reset baseline measurements.
4. **Connect to LoRaWAN Network:**
   - Power the device and ensure it is within the range of your LoRaWAN gateway.
   - Follow instructions to enable the OTAA (Over-the-Air Activation) or ABP (Activation by Personalization) for network joining.
5. **Testing:** Verify functionality by checking data packets received at the server to ensure correct distance readings.
