### Technical Overview of MILESIGHT AM104

The MILESIGHT AM104 is an advanced indoor environmental monitoring sensor designed to capture various parameters crucial for evaluating atmosphere quality and occupancy comfort in indoor spaces. The sensor is part of MILESIGHT's LoRaWAN-based devices, enabling long-range, low-power communication ideal for Smart Buildings, offices, and residential applications.

#### Working Principles

The AM104 is equipped with multiple sensors to monitor:

- **Temperature**: Measures ambient temperature.
- **Humidity**: Captures relative humidity in the air.
- **CO2 Levels**: Monitors carbon dioxide concentration.
- **TVOCs (Total Volatile Organic Compounds)**: Assesses the presence of harmful gases including off-gassing from materials.
- **Barometric Pressure**: Measures atmospheric pressure.
- **Illuminance**: Detects light intensity.

Data from these sensors are processed and transmitted via LoRaWAN to a central platform for real-time monitoring or historical data analysis.

#### Installation Guide

1. **Unboxing and Setup**: Carefully unbox the device and ensure all components, including the sensor unit and mounting accessories, are included.

2. **Select a Location**: Place the AM104 at a height of around 1.5 to 2 meters above the ground to capture representative environmental data. Ensure it’s away from windows, direct sunlight, and vents.

3. **Mounting**: Use the included adhesive pads or screws to mount the device securely on the chosen surface.

4. **Commissioning**: Power on the device. It typically arrives with pre-inserted batteries. Initiate a connection to the LoRaWAN network by following the network provider's instructions to register the device.

5. **Configuration**: Use MILESIGHT’s configuration tools or dashboard to set data transmission intervals and alert thresholds as required.

6. **Calibration**: The device undergoes self-calibration, but it’s advisable to cross-reference initial sensor readings for consistency.

#### LoRaWAN Details

- **Frequency Bands**: Operates on standard LoRaWAN frequency bands such as EU868, US915, AS923, and others depending on regional availability.
- **Network Protocol**: Meets the LoRaWAN 1.0.3 protocol specification.
- **Transmission Power**: Adjustable up to maximum allowable for region (typically 14 dBm in the EU band).
- **Data Rate and Range**: Supports ADR (Adaptive Data Rate) with ranges up to 10 kilometers in rural areas and several hundred meters in dense urban settings.

#### Power Consumption

- **Power Supply**: Operates on replaceable batteries (Alkaline or Lithium AA), with a typical lifespan of more than 2 years, depending on the reporting interval and environmental conditions.
- **Sleep Mode**: Utilizes low-power sleep modes between data transmissions to conserve energy.
- **Energy Efficiency**: Designed for minimal energy use, the AM104 optimizes power by adjusting sensor sampling and transmission intervals as per configuration.

#### Use Cases

The AM104 is versatile and can be deployed in various scenarios:

- **Smart Buildings**: Monitor indoor air quality and climate conditions for energy-efficient HVAC control.
- **Offices/Workplaces**: Ensure healthy working conditions by tracking occupancy-related air changes.
- **Residential Spaces**: Enhance indoor living conditions with continuous environmental monitoring.
- **Hospitals & Clinics**: Monitor air quality to minimize patient exposure to harmful pollutants.
- **Schools & Universities**: Maintain safe and comfortable learning environments.

#### Limitations

- **Indoor Use Only**: The AM104 is specifically designed for indoor environments; outdoor use can lead to inaccurate readings and potential device damage.
- **Network Dependency**: Relies on LoRaWAN network availability and quality for effective data communication.
- **Sensor Drift**: CO2 and TVOC sensors may require periodic calibration or replacement for optimal accuracy over extended use.
- **Range Limitations in Dense Environments**: Buildings with heavy structural elements may impede transmission range and require additional network infrastructure such as repeaters or gateways.

In conclusion, the MILESIGHT AM104 offers a comprehensive solution for maintaining high standards of indoor environmental quality through its robust sensor suite and reliable LoRaWAN communication, albeit with considerations regarding deployment environments and network connectivity requirements.
