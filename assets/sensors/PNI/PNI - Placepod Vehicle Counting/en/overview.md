# PNI PlacePod Vehicle Counting Technical Overview

## Introduction

The PNI PlacePod is an advanced wireless vehicle detection sensor designed to provide reliable vehicle presence and counting data for parking management applications. Utilizing cutting-edge technology, it offers accurate vehicle detection information to optimize operations like parking space management and traffic monitoring. The sensor is part of a comprehensive smart parking solution that connects to a broader IoT network via LoRaWAN, enabling real-time data analysis and decision-making. 

## Working Principles

The PNI PlacePod employs magneto-inductive sensing technology as its primary method of detecting the presence and occupancy of vehicles in a designated space. This technology is highly sensitive to minute changes in the earth's magnetic field caused by the presence of large metal objects (vehicles). This capability ensures accurate vehicle detection under various environmental conditions and surfaces, including asphalt and concrete.

### Key Features:
- **Adaptive Calibration**: The sensor dynamically calibrates to changes in its environment, allowing it to maintain high accuracy.
- **Low Power Operation**: Designed as an energy-efficient solution to ensure long-term deployment with minimal maintenance.

## Installation Guide

1. **Site Survey and Planning**: Identify and mark the desired locations for sensor placement. Ensure clear line of sight for signal transmission and accessibility for installation.

2. **Surface Preparation**: Clean the area where the sensor will be installed to ensure proper adhesion and performance. Use appropriate tools to remove any debris or residues.

3. **Sensor Placement**:
   - For surface mounts, position the sensor directly on top of the pavement and secure using screws or high-strength adhesive compatible with the surface material.
   - For in-ground mounts, core drill a hole of the appropriate diameter and depth. Insert the disc-shaped sensor into the cavity, ensuring the top surface is flush with the parking surface.

4. **Activation and Calibration**: Activate the sensor via wireless communication with its paired gateway or device. Allow the sensor to calibrate to the surrounding magnetic environment, following guidelines specified in the product manual.

5. **Connectivity Test**: Verify the sensorâ€™s connectivity with the LoRaWAN network gateway. Ensure successful data transmission before closing the installation checklist.

## LoRaWAN Communication Details

The PNI PlacePod transmits vehicle presence data via LoRaWAN, a low-power, long-range wireless protocol ideal for IoT applications. 

### Configuration:
- **Frequency**: Operates within standard LoRaWAN frequencies, specific to regional configurations (e.g., EU868, US915).
- **Data Rate**: Utilizes adaptive data rate (ADR) to optimize network capacity and battery life.
- **Network Integration**: Compatible with existing LoRaWAN network servers, requiring configuration for device recognition and data routing.

### Security:
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Ensures data integrity and privacy from sensor to application.
- **Device Authentication**: Uses a unique DevEUI and AppKey for secure network entry.

## Power Consumption

The PlacePod features an ultra-low-power design that extends battery life, crucial for minimizing maintenance. The sensor's power consumption profile allows for up to several years of autonomous operation, dependent on transmission frequency and environmental conditions.

### Power Profile:
- **Average Consumption**: <20 microamperes in standby mode.
- **Peak Consumption**: Occurs during transmission, with consumption typically within a range allowing for efficient battery usage.

## Use Cases

1. **Smart Parking Solutions**: Real-time monitoring and management of parking spaces in urban environments.
2. **Traffic Analysis**: Collection of data for vehicle flow and congestion analysis in road networks.
3. **Analytics and Reporting**: Integration with data platforms for strategic planning and predictive analytics in smart cities.

## Limitations

While the PNI PlacePod offers significant benefits, it has limitations to consider:

- **Obstructions**: Metal objects other than vehicles near the sensor may affect accuracy.
- **Signal Interference**: Dense urban environments with significant electromagnetic noise may impact communication.
- **Installation Constraints**: Requires careful placement and calibration to optimize performance in varying environmental conditions.

Overall, the PNI PlacePod Vehicle Counting sensor positions itself as a robust solution for a variety of vehicle-detection applications, contributing effectively to the smart city landscape through efficient design and seamless integration with modern IoT infrastructure.
