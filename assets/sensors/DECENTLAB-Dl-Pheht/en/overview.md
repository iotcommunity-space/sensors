## Technical Overview for DECENTLAB - DL-PHEHT Sensor

The DECENTLAB DL-PHEHT is a sophisticated Internet of Things (IoT) device designed for environmental monitoring. This advanced sensor integrates multiple functionalities, measuring pH, electrical conductivity (EC), humidity, temperature, barometric pressure, and more, making it ideal for a wide range of environmental and industrial applications.

### Working Principles

The DL-PHEHT operates by utilizing probes and integrated sensors to measure environmental parameters:

- **pH Measurement:** Utilizes a durable glass electrode and reference electrode for potentiometric measurements, providing accurate and stable pH readings.
- **Electrical Conductivity:** Employs an electrochemical sensor to measure the ionic content in a solution, indicating its conductivity.
- **Humidity and Temperature:** Uses a capacitive humidity sensor and a thermistor temperature sensor for precise atmospheric readings.
- **Barometric Pressure:** Measures atmospheric pressure using a piezoresistive sensor.

Each sensor is calibrated for precision and can operate effectively in various environmental conditions. Data is processed and transmitted over LoRaWAN, a low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) protocol that allows long-distance communication in IoT applications.

### Installation Guide

1. **Site Selection:** Choose a location that provides accurate environmental representation and adheres to the pH and EC sensor's exposure preferences.
   
2. **Mounting:** Secure the sensor using its mounting bracket. Ensure that it's stable and the probes are correctly immersed or exposed according to measurement needs (e.g., submerging pH and EC sensors in liquid).

3. **Power On:** Insert batteries or connect the sensor to an appropriate power source. Check the indicator lights to ensure successful power-up.

4. **Network Configuration:** Set up connection parameters through the device's interface for LoRaWAN communication. Ensure the device's DevEUI, AppEUI, and AppKey (if applicable) are correctly inputted into your LoRaWAN network server.

5. **Calibration:** Reference documentation for calibrating the pH and EC sensors using standard calibration solutions as needed.

6. **Testing and Validation:** Initial testing through the network server to ensure accurate data transmission and reception.

### LoRaWAN Details

- **Frequency Bands:** Compatible with various regional bands such as EU868, US915, and AS923.
- **Communication Range:** Typically supports ranges of several kilometers in rural settings and several hundred meters in urban environments due to the LoRa modulation scheme.
- **Data Transmission:** Utilizes adaptive data rate (ADR) for efficient bandwidth use and longer battery life.
- **Network Management:** Requires integration with a LoRaWAN network server for data management, firmware updates, and device configuration.

### Power Consumption

The DL-PHEHT is designed for low power consumption, mainly driven by its energy-efficient components and LoRaWAN protocol capabilities. The device relies on:

- **Battery Type:** Utilizes replaceable batteries, typically AA-size, ensuring extended operational life in remote deployments.
- **Power Saving Modes:** Includes sleep and low-power operational modes, diminishing energy usage when not actively transmitting.
- **Battery Life:** Estimated battery life can extend several years, depending on configuration (such as transmission interval and environmental conditions).

### Use Cases

- **Agricultural Monitoring:** Suitable for soil pH and nutrient levels monitoring, ensuring optimal crop conditions.
- **Environmental Research:** Provides datasets for research on water bodies by continuously tracking pH, EC, and atmospheric conditions.
- **Industrial Applications:** Can be used in wastewater and effluent plants to monitor chemical parameters, ensuring compliance with environmental standards.
- **Weather Stations:** Assists in creating comprehensive microclimate profiles by integrating atmospheric data.

### Limitations

- **Calibration Needs:** Regular calibration of pH and EC sensors is needed to maintain measurement accuracy. 
- **Placement Constraints:** Environmental conditions can impact sensor efficacy; for example, extreme temperatures or improper probe submersion can skew results.
- **Data Transmission Dependency:** Successful data logging is contingent on stable LoRaWAN connectivity, which can be disrupted by obstructions or interference in urban settings.

In summary, the DECENTLAB DL-PHEHT delivers versatile and comprehensive environmental monitoring capabilities, with considerations needed for setup and maintenance to maximize sensor performance.
