**Technical Overview: TTN Smart Sensor (Adeunis)**

**Working Principles**

The TTN Smart Sensor (Adeunis) is a strategically designed IoT device that collects and transmits data using long-range, low-power wireless platforms like LoRaWAN. It leverages a multitude of integrated sensors to record motion, temperature, humidity, and light levels to offer diverse data output. It follows these key working principles:

1. Sensor Input: The integrated sensors collect data from the environment based on their respective capabilities. 

2. Processing: The collected data is then processed and converted into a format suitable for transmission.

3. Communication: Data is sent over the LoRaWAN network to be interpreted and analyzed by a separate IoT platform or application.

**Installation Guide**

1. Unpack and carefully review the contents and hardware. It should contain the Smart Sensor and necessary mounting hardware.

2. Place or mount the sensor in the desired location, ensuring that it isn't debugging or facing physical obstructions. 

3. Turn on the sensor by switching the on/off button to the "on" position.

4. Connect the sensor to the LoRaWAN network by following specific network's connection procedures. 

**LoRaWAN Details**

LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) is a protocol for WANs designed to support huge networks, like smart cities, with millions of low-power devices. The TTN Smart Sensor operates on LoRaWAN specification 1.0.2, transmitting on multiple channels and providing adaptive data rate support. This permits long-range communication with low power consumption.

**Power Consumption**

One of the advantages of the TTN Smart Sensor (Adeunis) is its low power consumption. It is powered by a long-life battery, able to provide up to 1-2 years' deployment depending on the transmission rate and environmental conditions. As a result, it is highly beneficial for long-range, infrequent data communication contexts.

**Use Cases**

TTN Smart Sensor finds applications in a variety of contexts due to its versatility:

1. Environmental Monitoring: Temperature, humidity, and light sensors provide crucial data for maintaining optimal conditions in various environments like warehouses or greenhouses.

2. Asset Tracking: With a built-in motion sensor, the device allows tracking and motion-detection use cases in logistics and supply chain sectors. 

3. Smart Buildings & Cities: For the deployment in smart infrastructures for monitoring various parameters and enhancing utility management.

**Limitations**

1. Network Dependency: Since the sensor transmits data using the LoRaWAN network, any network issues may impact the performance of the sensor.

2. Limited Data Rate: As with many LoRaWAN devices, the TTN Smart Sensor may not be suitable for applications that require high data rate transmission.

3. Fixed Function: Unlike some IoT devices which can have their sensing functions re-programmed, the TTN Smart Sensor has fixed sensors (temperature, light, humidity, motion) and cannot be modified for other data collection. 

4. Environmental Factors: Severe weather conditions could potentially affect sensor readings and battery life. Therefore, it's crucial to evaluate the installation site to make sure it's appropriate for the sensor.
