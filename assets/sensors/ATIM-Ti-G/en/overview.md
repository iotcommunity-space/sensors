# ATIM - Ti G (Temperature Sensor) Technical Overview

## Introduction

The ATIM Ti G is a robust, low-power wireless temperature sensor designed for seamless integration in IoT networks. This device is built to operate using the LoRaWAN protocol, ensuring long-range communication capabilities with optimized power use. It is ideal for applications requiring real-time temperature monitoring and data transmission in various environments.

## Working Principles

The ATIM Ti G operates by continuously measuring ambient temperature using its integrated high-precision temperature sensor. The sensor converts the temperature into an electronic signal which is then processed and encapsulated into a data packet. This packet is transmitted over a LoRaWAN network to a remote server or gateway for further processing or analysis. The LoRa modulation not only ensures long-range communication but also maintains low power consumption during data transmission.

### Key Features:
- **Temperature Detection:** Measures a wide range of temperatures with high accuracy.
- **LoRaWAN Connectivity:** Utilizes LoRa modulation for long-range, low-power communication.
- **Rugged Design:** Suitable for various environmental conditions including industrial settings.

## Installation Guide

### Pre-installation Checklist:
1. **LoRaWAN Network Availability:** Ensure there is a LoRaWAN network coverage in your installation area.
2. **Gateway Configuration:** The LoRaWAN gateway must be configured to accept connections from the ATIM Ti G sensor.
3. **Device Activation:** Ensure the sensor is compatible with the activation mode (OTAA/ABP) planned for the network.

### Installation Steps:
1. **Site Selection:** Choose a location where temperature readings are required. Avoid direct exposure to extreme environmental factors unless the sensor is rated for such conditions.
2. **Mounting the Sensor:**
   - Mount the sensor securely using the provided brackets or mounting hardware.
   - Ensure the sensor is free from physical obstructions that may impede temperature measurements.
3. **Power Connection:** Insert the batteries as per the instructions in the user manual. Ensure correct polarity and secure fit.
4. **Device Registration:**
   - Register the sensor on your LoRaWAN network using the provided DevEUI, AppEUI, and AppKey (for OTAA).
   - Assign relevant network parameters for effective communication.
5. **Testing:** Verify the device connection and ensure data packets are being received at the network server.
