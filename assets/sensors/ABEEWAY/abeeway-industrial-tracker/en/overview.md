# ABEEWAY - Industrial Tracker (ABEEWAY) Technical Overview

## Introduction

The ABEEWAY Industrial Tracker is a versatile and durable tracking device designed for industrial environments. It harnesses the advantages of LoRaWAN connectivity to provide reliable, long-range, and low-power location tracking for assets across various sectors. This document provides a detailed technical overview of its working principles, installation guide, LoRaWAN capabilities, power consumption metrics, use cases, and limitations.

## Working Principles

The Industrial Tracker combines multiple location technologies, including GPS, Wi-Fi sniffing, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and LoRaWAN, to offer precise positioning both indoors and outdoors. When outdoors, the device primarily uses GPS for high-accuracy localization. For indoor environments, where GPS signals are weak or unavailable, it leverages Wi-Fi and BLE to approximate location. The data is then transmitted over LoRaWAN networks to the central management system for processing and analysis.

Key features of the working principles include:
- **Multi-technology Positioning**: GPS, Wi-Fi, BLE, and LoRaWAN for adaptive tracking.
- **Energy-Efficient Design**: Utilizes adaptive data transmission strategies to conserve power based on location accuracy requirements and signal availability.
- **Geo-fencing Capabilities**: Alerts when tracked assets move in or out of predefined areas.

## Installation Guide

### Steps for Installation:

1. **Device Activation**: Ensure the tracker is charged. Use the provided USB cable to connect it to a power source if necessary. Once charged, activate the device by pressing and holding the power button until the LED indicator flashes.

2. **Network Configuration**: Using a suitable LoRaWAN network server, register the device by entering its unique Device EUI, Application EUI, and App Key for encryption.

3. **Placement**: Install the device on the asset to be tracked. It's essential that the device faces upwards to ensure an unobstructed view of the sky for optimal GPS signal reception.

4. **Connect to a Dashboard**: Integrate the device with your IoT dashboard for real-time tracking and monitoring. This setup involves software configuration provided by the platform and setting up alerts or report generation.

5. **Testing**: Verify the installation by conducting a few test movements to ensure that the device is transmitting location data accurately to the configured network and application.

## LoRaWAN Details

ABEEWAY's Industrial Tracker uses LoRaWAN, a low-power wide-area network protocol designed to wirelessly connect battery-operated things to the internet in regional, national, or global networks. Key specifications include:

- **Frequency Bands**: Available options are compliant with various regional regulations (e.g., EU868 for Europe, US915 for North America).
- **Class A & C Devices**: Supports multiple device classes to cater to different uplink and downlink needs.
- **Adaptive Data Rate (ADR)**: Dynamically adjusts the data rate for optimal performance and battery life.

## Power Consumption

The power consumption of the Industrial Tracker is a critical consideration for long-term deployments. It is efficiently designed to stay operational for extended periods without frequent recharging.

- **Battery Life**: Depending on the usage scenario, a fully charged device can last from several months to years. Smart power-saving modes are activated when stationary or in low-activity states.
- **Consumption Metrics**: In active GPS mode, it may consume 45-50 mA, and in sleep mode, it consumes less than 10 ÂµA.

## Use Cases

The ABEEWAY Industrial Tracker is engineered for a multitude of industrial applications:

- **Supply Chain and Logistics**: For tracking containers, pallets, and vehicles, ensuring the efficient management of fleet and inventory.
- **Construction and Mining**: Monitoring machinery and equipment location and usage.
- **Manufacturing**: Asset tracking within large factories and warehouses to streamline operations.

## Limitations

While versatile, the ABEEWAY Industrial Tracker has certain limitations:

- **Signal Dependence**: GPS accuracy diminishes indoors, and its reliance shifts to Wi-Fi and BLE, which might not provide precise localization.
- **Network Connectivity**: Requires a LoRaWAN network, which may not be available in very remote areas.
- **Environmental Impact**: Extreme weather conditions or dense urban environments could affect signal strength and tracking accuracy.

## Conclusion

The ABEEWAY Industrial Tracker is a robust solution for industries needing reliable and versatile asset tracking. Its technological design exploits multiple connectivity and localization strategies to offer adaptability across various environments while safeguarding battery life. Understanding its working principles, proper installation, and network details can optimize its performance to meet specific industrial requirements.
