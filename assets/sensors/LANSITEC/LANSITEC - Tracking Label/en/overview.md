### Technical Overview: LANSITEC - Tracking Label

The LANSITEC Tracking Label is an advanced IoT solution developed for asset tracking and management. Leveraging LoRaWAN technology, this tracking label provides long-range, low power, and secure connectivity for a wide range of applications.

#### Working Principles

The LANSITEC Tracking Label operates based on LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) protocol. LoRaWAN is a media access control (MAC) layer protocol designed to connect battery operated things wirelessly to the internet in regional, national or global networks. The core of its functionality lies in the label's ability to transmit data over large distances with minimal power consumption, making it suitable for remote or hard-to-reach tracking scenarios.

1. **Data Transmission:** The label collects data such as location coordinates and other sensor readings internally and transmits them using LoRa modulation to a connected network of gateways.
2. **Network Connectivity:** LoRa modulation allows for long-range communication capabilities, enabling data to be transmitted over several kilometers without the need for cellular data.
3. **Data Processing:** Once data is transmitted to the respective gateway, it is processed via network servers where it can be integrated into asset management systems.

#### Installation Guide

1. **Positioning:** Identify the asset or object that needs tracking, and affix the tracking label using adhesive backing. Ensure that the surface is clean and dry prior to application.
2. **Activation:** Activate the label by pressing the designated power button until the LED indicator flashes. This signals that the label is now active and ready for configuration.
3. **Configuration:** Using a LoRaWAN network server, configure the label by setting the necessary parameters (e.g., transmission intervals, network settings). Ensure that the device joins the network by confirming in the server interface.
4. **Placement:** Finalize the installation by testing its data transmission in the intended environment to ensure reliable connectivity.

#### LoRaWAN Details

- **Frequency Bands:** Supports a variety of LoRaWAN frequency bands, including EU868, US915, AS923, depending on regional regulation.
- **Data Rates:** Supports a range of data rates from 0.3 kbps to 50 kbps, enabling trade-offs between network capacity and communication range.
- **Network Capacity:** Capable of long-range data transmission up to 10 km in rural environments and up to 3 km in urban environments with line of sight (actual range depends on environmental factors).

#### Power Consumption

The LANSITEC Tracking Label is designed for low power consumption, making it efficient for long-term use:

- **Battery Life:** Typically exceeds 1 year depending on usage patterns. Factors that affect battery life include transmission frequency, data payload size, and environmental conditions.
- **Battery Type:** Utilizes a non-rechargeable Lithium battery. Battery replacement might require professional service to ensure sealing integrity.

#### Use Cases

1. **Asset Tracking:** Ideal for warehouses, logistics, and supply chain management where tracking the movement of assets is crucial.
2. **Fleet Management:** Track the real-time location of vehicles or machinery in logistics operations.
3. **Inventory Management:** Use in large storage facilities to track the location and movement of valuable inventory.
4. **Remote Monitoring:** Deploy in agriculture or rural settings where real-time data on asset location is required without relying on cellular coverage.

#### Limitations

1. **Coverage Limitations:** Efficiency of the label depends on the proximity to LoRaWAN gateways; far distances without enough gateways might reduce reliability.
2. **Obstruction Interference:** Signal strength can be affected by physical obstructions such as buildings, trees, or heavy rain, which can degrade performance.
3. **Limited Data Throughput:** The LoRaWAN protocol is designed for smaller data packets, limiting its use for applications that require high data throughput.
4. **Fixed Battery:** The embedded non-rechargeable battery limits the lifespan of the label beyond its battery capacity, necessitating replacement of the entire unit.

The LANSITEC Tracking Label offers a robust solution for varied tracking scenarios, balancing energy efficiency with wide-range capabilities, making it well-suited for IoT implementations in asset management.
