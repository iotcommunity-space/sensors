# LANSITEC Nb IoT Container Tracker - Technical Overview

The LANSITEC Nb IoT Container Tracker is a robust, highly efficient device designed to provide real-time location and condition monitoring for containers across the globe. Utilizing the narrowband Internet of Things (Nb-IoT) technology, this tracker offers extensive coverage, efficient power usage, and reliable data transmission, making it ideal for supply chain and logistics applications.

## Working Principles

The LANSITEC Nb IoT Container Tracker primarily operates using Nb-IoT technology, a cellular LPWAN technology designed for IoT devices. It utilizes existing LTE network infrastructures to provide enhanced coverage and deep indoor penetration. This tracker collects and transmits diverse data, including GPS location, temperature, humidity, shock, and orientation. Data collected by the tracker is sent via Nb-IoT networks to a cloud platform or other designated systems for further analysis and monitoring.

### Key Components:
- **GPS Module:** For accurate real-time geolocation.
- **Nb-IoT Module:** For data communication over cellular networks.
- **Sensors:** For environmental monitoring, including temperature, humidity, etc.
- **Battery Pack:** Powers the device, designed for extended use.
- **Microcontroller:** For data processing and management.

## Installation Guide

1. **Site Survey:** Perform a site survey of the container to ensure optimal signal reception.
2. **Mounting the Device:**
   - Select an appropriate location on the container where the tracker can have clear access to the sky (for GPS signal).
   - Use the provided mounting brackets or adhesive pads to securely attach the device.
3. **Power Activation:** 
   - Insert or charge the battery if required. Some models come with a pre-installed battery that needs to be activated by pulling a tab.
4. **Connectivity Check:**
   - Switch on the device and wait for the signal and connection indicators to confirm Nb-IoT network connectivity.
5. **System Configuration:**
   - Configure the device settings using the mobile app or desktop software as per operational requirements.

## LoRaWAN Details

Although the LANSITEC Nb IoT Container Tracker is primarily based on Nb-IoT technology, it is structurally compatible with LoRaWAN systems. If required, the tracker can be configured to switch to LoRaWAN networks for operational redundancy in areas where Nb-IoT network coverage is insufficient. LoRaWAN is a long-range, low-power protocol commonly used for IoT applications.

## Power Consumption

The LANSITEC tracker is designed for low power consumption to maximize battery life. Typical battery operation can last several years, depending on factors such as network conditions, transmission frequency, and environmental monitoring intervals. The device employs power-saving modes during inactivity to conserve energy.

### Battery Specifications:
- **Type:** Lithium Thionyl Chloride (Li-SOCl2)
- **Capacity:** Typically ranges from 5000mAh to 10,000mAh
- **Expected Lifespan:** Up to 5 years with standard usage.

## Use Cases

1. **Global Shipping & Logistics:**
   - Real-time tracking and condition monitoring during transcontinental journeys.
  
2. **Supply Chain Management:**
   - Monitoring environmental conditions to ensure product quality, especially for perishables.

3. **Asset Management:**
   - Ensuring the security and location visibility of high-value or sensitive goods.

4. **Cold Chain Logistics:**
   - Continuous monitoring of temperature-sensitive shipments like pharmaceuticals and food products.

## Limitations

1. **Network Dependency:** 
   - Reliant on Nb-IoT network coverage, which might be limited in rural or isolated areas.
   
2. **Installation Constraints:**
   - Requires an unobstructed view of the sky for optimal GPS performance, which can be challenging in densely packed environments or within heavily metallic areas.

3. **Battery Life vs. Usage Ratio:**
   - Battery life may decrease significantly with more frequent sensor data collection or transmission intervals.

4. **Environmental Resistance:**
   - Although generally robust, extreme environmental conditions may affect sensor accuracy and device durability.

In conclusion, the LANSITEC Nb IoT Container Tracker is an advanced solution for continuous container tracking and monitoring, offering ease of deployment, and remarkable operational efficiency in IoT-enabled logistics and supply chain management. While it has certain limitations, the deviceâ€™s advanced features and operational flexibility provide significant logistical advantages in most use cases.
