### Technical Overview for LANSITEC - Temperature Humidity Sensor

The LANSITEC Temperature Humidity Sensor is a highly precise IoT device designed to monitor environmental conditions. This sensor leverages LoRaWAN technology for reliable, long-distance wireless communication, ensuring efficient data transmission from remote locations.

#### Working Principles

The LANSITEC Temperature Humidity Sensor operates using highly sensitive thermistors and capacitive humidity sensing elements. These components convert temperature and humidity changes into electrical signals. The sensor's microcontroller processes these signals and manages data packet creation for transmission over LoRaWAN networks. The measurement data is periodically sent at customizable intervals, enabling timely insights into environmental conditions.

#### Installation Guide

1. **Site Selection**: Install the sensor in an area representing the desired atmosphere for accurate readings. Avoid locations with direct sunlight, excessive dust, or extreme vibration.

2. **Mounting**: Use the provided mounting hardware to secure the sensor on a flat surface. Ensure that airflow around the sensor is not obstructed to allow for accurate measurements.

3. **Orientation**: Install the sensor vertically to prevent water or dust accumulation on the protective housing.

4. **Power**: The sensor is battery-powered, removing the need for electrical wiring. Ensure the battery compartment is properly sealed to maintain the device's IP65 ingress protection.

5. **Activation**: Switch on the sensor via the activation button, and check the status indicator to confirm device readiness. 

6. **Configuration**: Use the LANSITEC App or a compatible network server to configure network settings, such as device address, application keys, and data rate.
