# Technical Overview: LANSITEC Precision Platinum Sensor (LANSITEC)

## Introduction

The LANSITEC Precision Platinum Sensor is a highly accurate environmental monitoring device designed for precision applications across various industries. Incorporating advanced sensing technologies, it ensures reliable data collection and seamless integration into IoT systems via LoRaWAN communication.

## Working Principles

### Sensor Technology
The LANSITEC Precision Platinum Sensor utilizes a platinum-based resistance temperature detector (RTD) element. With its precision, the sensor measures temperature variations with exceptional accuracy, typically characterized by a high degree of linearity and stability over a wide temperature range. The RTD operates on the principle of resistance change concerning temperature variations, providing precise thermal readings.

### Signal Processing
The sensor includes an integrated analog-to-digital converter (ADC) that processes the analog signal from the RTD. Sophisticated onboard algorithms are employed to calibrate and linearize the temperature data, ensuring high fidelity of the transmitted information.

## Installation Guide

1. **Site Assessment**: Identify an appropriate location for sensor installation, ensuring it’s within the specified environmental conditions and away from direct interference sources.

2. **Mounting**: Utilize the mounting kit provided with the sensor. Secure it to a stable structure using screws or adhesives, depending on the mounting surface.

3. **Power Configuration**: Insert the battery or connect an external power source as per the power guide. Ensure correct orientation and contact for optimal performance.

4. **LoRaWAN Configuration**: Use the provided configuration tool or app to set the LoRaWAN parameters, such as DevEUI, AppEUI, and AppKey. Ensure the sensor is within range of a compatible LoRaWAN gateway.

5. **Activation**: Power on the sensor and perform a connectivity test to confirm successful data transmission to the cloud-based platform.

6. **Calibration (if necessary)**: Although factory calibrated, additional site-specific calibration could improve accuracy. Follow the calibration procedure using standard references if needed.
