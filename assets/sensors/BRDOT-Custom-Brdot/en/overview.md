# Technical Overview for BRDOT - Custom Brdot

## Introduction

The BRDOT - Custom Brdot is an advanced Internet of Things (IoT) sensor designed to provide real-time data collection and analytics across various environments. It leverages LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) technology to transmit data over long distances with minimal power consumption, making it ideal for remote monitoring applications.

## Working Principles

The BRDOT sensor operates on the principle of detecting environmental variables such as temperature, humidity, pressure, and other specific metrics pertinent to your application. Each BRDOT unit is equipped with multiple onboard sensors tailored to its designated use-case. Once the sensor collects data, it processes the information within the unit before transmitting the data packets to a centralized server via LoRaWAN.

### Key Components:
- **Sensor Array**: Customizable sensors for tailored data collection.
- **Microcontroller**: ARM Cortex-M series microcontroller for efficient data processing.
- **LoRaWAN Module**: Operates in the unlicensed ISM bands (EU868, US915, AS923, etc.) with adaptive data rates.
- **Power Management Circuitry**: Optimized for low power consumption.

## Installation Guide

### Step 1: Site Assessment
Conduct a comprehensive site survey to determine the best installation points for effective environmental monitoring and reliable LoRaWAN connectivity.

### Step 2: Mounting
1. Choose a secure location for mounting the BRDOT sensor, ensuring it's within the operational environment for accurate data collection.
2. Use the provided mounting brackets to securely fix the sensor. Ensure the sensor’s face is unobstructed and oriented as recommended in the product manual.

### Step 3: Configuration
1. Power up the device using its battery or connect it to an available power source.
2. Configure the device using the BRDOT mobile app or web interface, accessible via Bluetooth or USB connection, respectively.
3. Input gateway information to connect the sensor to the appropriate LoRaWAN network.

### Step 4: Testing
Perform initial tests to verify data transmission and system integrity. Check that data is accurately reaching the monitoring platform.

### Step 5: Finalize Installation
Once testing is successful, seal and secure all cable ports to protect against environmental factors such as water and dust.

## LoRaWAN Details

### Network Architecture
BRDOT sensors connect to a LoRaWAN Gateway operating in your region’s specific frequency band. The sensor uses Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) to optimize data transmission, balancing between range and data rate.

### Communication
- **Uplink Frequency**: The sensor sends uplinks between 125 kHz and 500 kHz spread spectrum signals.
- **Downlink Frequency**: Configurable based on the operator’s network.
- **Message Interval**: Configurable, ranging from every few minutes to several hours depending on the application and duty cycle constraints.

### Security
LoRaWAN ensures end-to-end AES128 encryption for secure data transmission between devices and the network server.

## Power Consumption

The BRDOT is designed for ultra-low power consumption, allowing for several years of operation on a single battery, depending on the reporting interval and the sensor array used. Typical power usage during idle is less than 10uA, while peak usage during data transmission can range from 10mA to 50mA.

### Power Supply Options
- **Battery**: Standard lithium batteries or rechargeable solutions as per application needs.
- **External Power**: Option to use a DC power supply for continuous operation.

## Use Cases

1. **Agricultural Monitoring**: Using soil moisture, temperature, and humidity sensors to optimize irrigation and crop conditions.
2. **Industrial Automation**: Monitoring environmental conditions in factories for optimal equipment operation.
3. **Smart Cities**: Integration with smart city infrastructure for pollution monitoring and energy management.
4. **Environmental Research**: Deploying in remote locations for wildlife and habitat monitoring without needing frequent visits.

## Limitations

- **Range Limitations**: While LoRaWAN provides extensive coverage, dense urban areas may affect transmission range and data integrity.
- **Data Rate Constraints**: Suitable for applications requiring low data rate transmission; not ideal for real-time video or high-resolution image transmission.
- **Sensor Compatibility**: Custom sensor configurations are available but may require additional calibration and setup, influencing initial implementation time.
- **Maintenance**: Regular maintenance checks necessary for battery-reliant deployments, especially in extreme weather conditions affecting battery life.

## Conclusion

The BRDOT - Custom Brdot sensor provides a versatile solution for remote environmental monitoring, utilizing LoRaWAN for long-distance communication while efficiently managing power consumption. However, careful consideration of installation conditions and regular maintenance are essential to maximize the sensor's effectiveness and operational life.
