### Ct Series - Ct305 Ct310 (Ct Series) Technical Overview 

The Ct Series (Ct305 and Ct310) are compact, wireless Internet of Things (IoT) current sensors designed to monitor the current flow in electrical conductors for various applications. 

#### Working Principles 
The data gathering process using the Ct Series sensors is based on non-invasive current transducers which allow measuring energy consumption through magnetic induction produced by the current passing in a wire. By harnessing this magnetic field, the Ct305 and Ct310 deliver highly-accurate current measurements without having to create any physical connections with the conductors.

#### Installation Guide
Installation of Ct Series sensors requires no shut-down of power or cutting of wires. The sensor simply clamps onto an existing AC power line to non-invasively measure the current. It facilitates simple, tool-free installation using a snap-on mechanism, and it requires no additional wiring.

#### LoRaWAN Details 
The Ct Series sensors employ LoRaWAN (Long Range Wireless Area Network) technology that enables bi-directional communication with a range of up to 15 km in rural areas and 5 km in urban settings. LoRaWAN's low-power protocol allows for efficient battery utilization, allowing the sensors to operate without requiring frequent power source replacement.

#### Power Consumption 
The Ct Series is known for their low power consumption, making them perfect for remote and inaccessible areas. The sensors operate by using power only while measurements and the transmission occurs and stay idle most of the time. However, the actual power consumption may vary based on the reporting frequency and the environmental conditions. 

#### Use Cases 
The Ct Series is ideal for electricity consumption and usage pattern monitoring and many more. It's widely used in energy management systems, diagnostic and preventive maintenance, and security systems. By monitoring the power usage, it allows for increased energy efficiency, improved sustainability efforts, and better operations management.

#### Limitations 
While the Ct Series sensors provide non-invasive, accurate current monitoring, they do have a few limitations. First, they can only measure AC current, not DC. Their operating temperature can range from -25 to 70 degrees Celsius, limiting their functionalities under extreme conditions. Moreover, the sensors' communication range could be shortened by barriers or signal interference, which should be considered during installation.

Overall, the Ct Series (Ct305 and Ct310) provide a comprehensive solution for monitoring current in a wide array of applications dynamically owing to their simple, non-invasive installation method, and low power consumption.
