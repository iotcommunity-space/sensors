# Technical Overview: DRAGINO - Lsn50v2-D23

## Overview
The DRAGINO Lsn50v2-D23 is a long-range LoRaWAN sensor node designed for outdoor IoT applications. This device is primarily used for environmental monitoring, leveraging a durable exterior to withstand various weather conditions. It operates on LoRaWAN protocol, allowing it to transmit data over long distances with minimal power consumption.

## Working Principles

### Sensor Accuracy and Functionality
The Lsn50v2-D23 includes a digital sensor that can accurately measure environmental parameters such as temperature and humidity. The embedded sensors convert the physical readings into electrical signals which are then processed and transmitted via LoRaWAN to an IoT server or data platform.

### LoRaWAN Communication
The sensor node utilizes the LoRaWAN protocol, which is a low-power, wide-area networking protocol designed to wirelessly connect battery-operated 'things' to the internet in regional, national, or global networks. It supports large numbers of devices over long distances using minimal power, thanks to its adaptive data rate capability and robust modulation techniques.

## Installation Guide

### Hardware Setup
