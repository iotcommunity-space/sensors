TTN Smart Sensor (Agriseen)

I. Technical Overview

The Things Network (TTN) Smart Sensor (Agriseen) features reliable, cost-effective, and highly adaptable technology designed to meet the demands of modern farms and agricultural businesses. The sensor leverages the Long Range (LoRa) and Low Power Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) technologies to provide robust, low-cost, long-range telemetry with a deep focus on low power consumption and accurate data collection.

II. Working Principle

The TTN Smart Sensor (Agriseen) operates by collecting real-time soil parameters such as temperature, humidity, moisture levels, and light intensity. The data collected from the physical environment is then transferred over a LoRaWAN to a network server. From this server, the data can be monitored and analyzed from any internet-connected device by leveraging cloud-based technology.

III. Installation Guide

Installation of the TTN Smart Sensor (Agriseen) involves a few key steps:
1. Physical deployment of the sensors at the designated locations on the farm.
2. Connection of the sensor devices to the TTN via a LoRa Gateway.
3. Configuration of the devices on the network server dashboard, and the setting of the desired location and other specifics.

IV. LoRaWAN Details

The communication between the TTN Smart Sensor (Agriseen) and the network server is facilitated by LoRaWAN technology. This technology enables low-cost, mobile, secure bi-directional communication in wide area networks. The LoRaWAN operates on 868MHz (EU) / 915MHz (US) / 433MHz (Asia) license-free bands providing 0.3 kbps to 50 kbps data rates.

V. Power Consumption

TTN Smart Sensor (Agriseen) has been designed with a major focus on energy efficiency in order to facilitate long-term, stand-alone operation. Using advanced low-power LoRa communication technology, these sensors can function for up to several years depending on the use case and configuration.

VI. Use Cases

The sensor is primarily designed for use in modern agriculture and farming practices. It can aid in precision farming by providing real-time updates about the soil quality and conditions. Besides precision agriculture, it can also serve in environmental monitoring, smart irrigation systems, and greenhouses, among others.

VII. Limitations

While the TTN Smart Sensor (Agriseen) possesses numerous advantages, it also has a few limitations:
1. The device needs a clear Line of Sight (LoS) with the LoRa Gateway to work effectively. Performance can be disrupted by physical barriers or extreme weather conditions.
2. The set data rates may be a limiting factor in applications requiring transmission of large amounts of data.
3. Set-up and configuration require technical expertise.
4. The sensor readings accuracy can be influenced by extreme environmental conditions.
