## Technical Overview: ZANE - Zcar 

### Working Principle

The ZANE - Zcar is an IoT device designed primarily to be an advanced automotive sensor in real-time. It uses state-of-the-art technological advancements to provide accurate telemetry and status monitoring of an automobile.

ZANE - Zcar functions by relying on the integration of multiple sensors that record and report details such as vehicle speed, location, fuel consumption, engine status, battery health, and much more. In addition, the device leverages IoT principles and advanced cloud-computing techniques to analyze and share this data instantly.

### Installation Guide

1. Attach the Zcar to your vehicle's OBD-II port, typically found under the dashboard on the driver's side.
2. Power up the Zcar module. The light indicator should turn green, indicating successful power-up.
3. Connect the Zcar to your car's computer through the given port.
4. Install the Zane software on your smartphone or a computer to receive constant updates and analytics.
5. Pair your Zcar device with the software by entering the device ID or scanning the QR code printed on the device.

### LoRaWAN Details

LoRaWAN (Low Range Wide Area Network) is the communication protocol used by ZANE - Zcar to transmit the gathered data to the cloud server and end devices like computers or mobile devices. The advantage of LoRaWAN is its long-range and low power consumption, making it ideal for IoT devices like ZANE - Zcar.

### Power Consumption

ZANE - Zcar is designed to be power-efficient. It consumes only 1 W of power during peak data transmission and as low as 200 mW in idle mode. This ensures the device remains operational for prolonged periods without significantly draining the vehicle battery.

### Use Cases

1. Fleet Management: ZANE - Zcar can provide essential data for fleet owners and managers to optimize routes, streamline fuel efficiency, monitor the health of vehicles, and track their locations.
2. Safety and Security: Real-time location tracking feature can be used to recover stolen vehicles. Also, any abrupt change in vehicle status triggers an immediate notification to the owner.
3. Maintenance: Regular reports on engine status and battery health help car owners schedule timely maintenance and prevent potential breakdowns.

### Limitations

1. ZANE - Zcar is compatible with vehicles that have an OBD-II port. This might limit its usage in older models of vehicles.
2. In areas with poor LoRaWAN reception, real-time data transmission may suffer, limiting the device's effectiveness.
3. While the device consumes minimal power, it might cause battery drainage issues in cars that stay idle for long periods.
4. The effectiveness of the ZANE - Zcar device is dependent on regular software updates. Failure to update could lead to inefficiencies or potential security risks.
