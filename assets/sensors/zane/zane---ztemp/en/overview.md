## ZANE - Ztemp Sensor: Technical Overview

### Working Principles:
The ZANE - Ztemp (ZANE) is a long range, low power temperature sensor powered by LoRaWAN. It uses a thermistor to measure the ambient temperature. As the temperature changes, the thermistor’s resistance changes correspondingly, which in turn modifies the voltage across the thermistor. Using this principle, the ZANE sensor successfully tracks and records temperature fluctuations.

### Installation Guide:
Installation of the ZANE sensor is straightforward: 
1. Attach the ZANE sensor to your desired location using the included mounting materials.
2. Connect the sensor to your LoRaWAN network by following the provided instructions. 
3. Configure the ZANE sensor to your requirements via the software interface.

### LoRaWAN Details:
The LoRaWAN (Long Range, Wide Area) network allows for wireless communication over a long range while using minimal power. Therefore, the ZANE sensor, operating in the ISM band, can transmit data over large distances (around 15 km urban range and up to 40 km in the countryside) with minimal power consumption. Being bi-directional, LoRaWAN allows not only data transmission from the ZANE sensor but also permits firmware updates over-the-air.

### Power Consumption:
ZANE's low power consumption is one of its significant advantages. Equipped with a 3.6V ER14505 AA Lithium Thionyl Chloride battery, the Ztemp sensor operates power-efficiently. Its power consumption is about 12 mA during transmission and less than 200 µA in standby mode. This enables the Ztemp sensor to have a life expectancy ranging from 5 to 10 years (depending on data transmission frequency).

### Use Cases:
The ZANE sensor offers various uses. It is ideal for environmental monitoring like agricultural applications, greenhouse or refrigeration control where temperature needs to be monitored remotely. Additionally, it is commonly used in industrial settings for process control and product quality assurance.

### Limitations:
While the ZANE-Ztemp sensor boasts numerous advantages, there are some limitations to consider:
1. Physical Obstructions: Despite the long range of LoRaWAN, physical obstacles such as buildings or hills can influence signal strength, reducing the transmission range.
2. Sensor Accuracy: The Ztemp sensor is highly precise. However, it may not be suitable for applications requiring extreme temperature accuracy.
3. Battery Replacement: Though it has long battery life, the battery will eventually deplete and need replacement. This could be an issue for sensors installed in inaccessible locations.
4. Ambient Conditions: The sensor is designed to operate within a certain range of temperature and humidity conditions. Operating it outside these recommended conditions may lead to inaccurate readings or other failures.
   
Overall, the ZANE-Ztemp sensor proves to be an effective choice for a wide range of applications, offering long-range communication and energy efficiency. Its limitations are minor in light of its cost-effectiveness and simple integration with LoRaWAN.
