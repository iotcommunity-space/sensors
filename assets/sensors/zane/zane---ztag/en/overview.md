# ZANE - Ztag (ZANE) Technical Overview

## Working Principles

ZANE Ztag leverages the advanced IoT principles, primarily functioning based on the LoRaWAN technology that is highly energy-efficient and has a remarkable range. It operates by monitoring, collecting, and transmitting data from its surrounding environment to a connected LoRaWAN gateway. It is capable of recording and transmitting various parameters such as temperature, humidity, movement, and light intensity. These parameters are monitored using the integrated sensors within the device and then periodically transmitted back to a centralized LoRaWAN gateway.

## Installation Guide

Installation of the ZANE Ztag primarily involves activating the device, registering the device on a LoRaWAN network, and then deploying it in the identified location. 

1. **Device Activation**: Activate the device by removing the insulation sheet to connect the battery.
2. **Device Registration**: Register the device on your LoRaWAN network by adding its unique Device EUI, App Key, and App EUI. These details are usually provided on the device packaging or can be obtained from the manufacturer.
3. **Device Deployment**: Place the device in the designated location ensuring that it is within range of a LoRaWAN gateway. Make sure the place is not subject to extreme weather or temperature conditions.

## LoRaWAN Details

ZANE Ztag operates on the LoRaWAN protocol, functioning in the unlicensed radio spectrum, specifically the EU 868 MHz and US 915 MHz bands. LoRaWAN is a media access control (MAC) layer protocol designed for large-scale public networks with a single operator. It provides seamless interoperability among smart devices without complex local installations and gives back the freedom to the user, developer, and businesses, enabling the rollover of private networks in a flexible and efficient manner.

## Power Consumption

ZANE Ztag boasts of ultra-low power consumption due to its reliance on the LoRaWAN technology and effective power management mechanisms built into the device. This results in prolonged lifespan and lower maintenance costs, as the device can run for years on a single battery.

## Use Cases

ZANE Ztag has a broad range of applications in various industries. Here are a few key use cases:

1. **Smart Agriculture**: ZANE Ztag can be used to monitor environmental parameters such as light, humidity, and temperature in fields, enabling optimized irrigation and fertilization.
2. **Supply Chain**: The movement detection feature can be used in the supply chain to track the transportation and handling of sensitive goods.
3. **Smart Buildings**: In offices and campuses, light and temperature monitoring can help save energy and improve comfort.

## Limitations

While ZANE Ztag is a versatile device, it has some limitations:

1. **Range**: The communication range depends heavily on the environment and the presence of obstacles. Urban areas and buildings may decrease the signal coverage.
2. **Data Rate**: Due to the use of the LoRaWAN technology, the device is not suited to transmit large amounts of data or for applications requiring real-time communication.
3. **Environmental Tolerance**: Although designed for robustness, the device might not withstand extreme environmental and weather conditions.
  
Despite these limitations, the ZANE Ztag stands out for its power efficiency, broad application range, and ease of deployment owing to the LoRaWAN technology.
