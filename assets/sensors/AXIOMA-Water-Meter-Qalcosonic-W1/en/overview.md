# Technical Overview: AXIOMA - Water Meter Qalcosonic W1

The AXIOMA Qalcosonic W1 is a state-of-the-art smart water meter designed for precision measurement and data communication in IoT environments. Recognized for its robust performance and integration capabilities, the Qalcosonic W1 uses advanced ultrasonic measurement principles and LoRaWAN technology for wide-area network deployments.

## Working Principles

### Ultrasonic Measurement
The Qalcosonic W1 utilizes the ultrasonic time-of-flight measurement principle. It generates ultrasonic waves that travel through the water. By measuring the transit time difference between waves moving with and against the flow, the Qalcosonic W1 calculates the flow rate. This method is highly accurate, maintenance-free, and suitable for various water qualities.

### Data Collection and Communication
Equipped with advanced microcontrollers, the Qalcosonic W1 collects accurate flow data and additional metrics like temperature and pressure. It processes and stores accumulated usage statistics internally, periodically sending this data over LoRaWAN, ensuring minimal latency in reporting.

## Installation Guide

1. **Site Requirements**:
   - Ensure a straight section of the pipe for installation, with a recommended minimum of 5 diameters upstream and 3 diameters downstream without protrusions to maintain measurement accuracy.
   - Verify that the chosen location is accessible for maintenance and within the LoRaWAN network range.

2. **Mechanical Installation**:
   - Shut off water flow and thoroughly clean the installation area.
   - Mount the Qalcosonic W1 vertically or horizontally, as per site requirements and space constraints. Align the arrow on the meter body with the water flow direction.
   - Secure the meter using appropriate mounting kits; over-tightening can damage the unit.

3. **Electrical and Network Installation**:
   - Ensure the device's antenna is correctly positioned to optimize signal strength.
   - Configure the LoRaWAN network settings via the accompanying software or a compatible configuration tool, setting correct parameters such as DevEUI, AppEUI, and AppKey.

4. **Calibration**:
   - Perform a manual check against a known flow benchmark to ensure the meter’s accuracy post-installation.

## LoRaWAN Details

- **Frequency Bands**: The Qalcosonic W1 supports various frequency bands (EU868, US915, etc.) contingent on regional availability and regulation.
- **Network Integration**: Seamless integration with LoRaWAN networks ensures long-range communication, low power consumption, and security via AES-128 encryption.
- **Data Rate**: Supports adaptive data rates, optimizing for range and power efficiency, with up to 51-byte payloads per transmission.

## Power Consumption

The Qalcosonic W1 is equipped with a long-lasting lithium battery, engineered for minimum power consumption, supporting up to 16 years of operation under standard conditions. The efficient sleep mode during non-communication intervals plays a crucial role in enhancing battery longevity.

## Use Cases

- **Residential Water Management**: Enables accurate billing and consumption monitoring for households, reducing discrepancies and enhancing customer transparency.
- **Utility and Municipality Monitoring**: Supports wide-scale deployment by city utilities, facilitating leak detection, demand management, and infrastructure planning.
- **Industrial Applications**: Suitable for water monitoring in facilities requiring precise water usage data for production processes, ensuring compliance with regulatory standards.
- **Smart Building Solutions**: Integration into home automation systems allows for comprehensive water usage analytics and remote control capabilities.

## Limitations

- **Network Dependency**: The effectiveness largely depends on the availability of a robust LoRaWAN network. Remote locations with poor network coverage might experience communication issues.
- **Installation Restrictions**: Requires specific installation conditions to ensure measurement accuracy, potentially complicating installs in non-standard or cramped spaces.
- **Water Quality Sensitivity**: Extremely turbid water may affect measurement accuracy, though this is minimized through ultrasonic technology.
- **Limited Real-Time Data**: Due to power-saving protocols, data transmission intervals may not provide real-time monitoring unless specifically configured, potentially reducing immediacy in fast-changing scenarios.

The AXIOMA Qalcosonic W1’s integration ability with IoT systems and its low maintenance demands make it an ideal choice for the evolving needs of smart metering and sustainable resource management across various sectors.
