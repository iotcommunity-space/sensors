## Am Series - Am300 V2 Sensor Technical Documentation

### Overview

The Am300 V2 Sensor belongs to the versatile IoT Am Series of environmental sensors. Designed for both indoor and outdoor usage, it offers real-time environmental surveillance, monitoring temperature, humidity, air quality, light intensity, and acoustic levels. Featuring advanced LoRaWAN module, the sensor ensures long-range communication up to several kilometers, offering a vast dimension for expansion. The device is housed in a robust casing that provides durability and reliability.


### Working Principle

The Am300 V2 utilizes a variety of built-in sensors to gather data about the surrounding environment. It records temperature, humidity, air quality, light intensity, and acoustics and transforms sensory data into digital data. This data can then be transmitted over the LoRaWAN network to the main control system where it can be visualized, analyzed, and acted upon.


### Installation Guide

The Am300 V2 sensor is quick and easy to install. Mount the base of the device onto the desired location, take care to ensure the sensor nodes are not obstructed. For power, insert the battery into the sensor housing and switch on the device. Connect it to the LoRaWAN network by pressing the configuration button for five seconds or until the LED indicator light starts to flash. Now follow your network provider's instructions to complete the device registration process.


### LoRaWAN Details

The Am300 V2 utilizes the LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) protocol for data transmission. This provides long-distance communication with lower power consumption. The LoRaWAN protocol is adaptable to set networks of different sizes - from small scale to massive, enabling a broad spectrum of IoT applications.


### Power Consumption

The Am300 V2 is designed for low power consumption, allowing it to run for years on a single battery. Power usage varies based on reporting frequencies and communication distance but generally falls within the micro-ampere range.


### Use Cases

The Am300 V2 sensor finds its utilization in a wide array of applications:

1. **Environment Monitoring**: Comprehend local weather conditions across large agricultural fields, enabling precision farming.

2. **Smart Buildings**: Provide data for HVAC systems to regulate temperature and humidity, ensuring comfortable living conditions.

3. **Industrial Plants**: Monitor changes in environment parameters to maintain safety and optimal performance.

4. **Cities**: Understand the noise, light, and air quality levels across different regions, contributing to a smart and healthy city environment.


### Limitations

While the Am300 V2 sensor comes with numerous advantages, the following limitations must be considered:

1. **Placement**: Sensors may not function correctly if mounted near heat sources or vents that disrupt atmospheric readings.

2. **Battery**: Since the sensor is battery-powered, it is crucial to monitor and replace the battery when required.

3. **LoRaWAN coverage**: The functionality of the device depends on the range and quality of the LoRaWAN coverage in the area.

4. **Interference**: Devices using the same frequency could lead to interference, negatively affecting the sensor's performance.
