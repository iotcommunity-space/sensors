# Am Series - Am103 Technical Documentation

## Overview 
The Am Series - Am103 is a robust, highly effective, and versatile sensor, designed specifically for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. It leverages LoRaWAN technology, providing a reliable yet long-range communication solution, ideal for any IoT solution needing seamless data transfer over large distances without worrying about network coverage in remote areas. 

## Working Principle 
The Am103 sensor monitors, measures, and communicates given parameters (based upon its design type), converting physical data to transmissible data packets. These packets are then transferred to a designated primary system using LoRaWAN technology, where the data can be processed and insights provided. 

## Installation Guide 
1. Unpack the Am103 sensor from the box and check for any visible damage or missing components. 
2. Find a correct location to position the sensor. Depending on the function this can be indoors or outdoors.
3. Fix the sensor to your desired location using the installation materials provided.
4. Power the device by the dedicated power source and wait for a few seconds for the initiation.
5. Follow the instructions provided in the package to connect the sensor to the LoRaWAN network. 

## LoRaWAN Details 
The Am103 operates using the LoRaWAN protocol, a low-power, wide-area network solution designed for IoT applications. The beauty of LoRaWAN is its ability to transmit data over long distances with low power consumption, perfect for IoT solutions. The Am103 uses the LoRaWAN protocol 1.02 for seamless and secure data communication. 

## Power Consumption 
The Am103 is an extremely power-efficient device and typically consumes less than 2W during operation. With power efficiency at its core, this sensor is designed with a sleep mode to further conserve energy.

## Use Cases 
Here are a few of the many possible use cases: 
1. **Agriculture** - The Am103 can be used to monitor soil moisture or temperature, enabling farmers to better manage irrigation and crop health.
2. **Industrial** - In manufacturing or other large industrial settings, the Am103 can be used to monitor machine usage, alerting maintenance when patterns suggest a machine may soon breakdown.
3. **Smart City Planning** - The Am103 can be used for various aspects of city planning, from monitoring air quality to waste management.

## Limitations 
While the Am103 sensor offers numerous benefits, a few limitations should be noted:
1. **Distance** - Although LoRaWAN technology provides an expansive reach, distance can still affect transmission quality and strength.
2. **Interference** - Despite LoRaWan's interference resistance, high levels of interference from other networks can influence performance.
3. **Maintenance** - Like all equipment, regular maintenance is necessary to keep the Am103 functioning at its optimal level. Regular battery checks and hardware inspection are essential.
4. **Weather Conditions** - Adverse weather conditions can affect the device's performance if it is not adequately shielded or protected.
