### Am Series - Am107 Overview

The Am107 from the Am Series is a standout in the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, offering genuine wireless connectivity via Longer Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) and a high degree of accurate monitoring in diverse environments. This sensor integrates with solution-based applications allowing businesses to monitor and control their processes and assets effectively.

#### Working Principle
The Am107 relies on passive infrared (PIR) sensors to detect heat signatures and movements. It functions by detecting infrared radiation thereby monitoring the occurrence of a person, animal, or other objects entering its detection range.

#### Installation Guide
Installing Am107 is straightforward. It can be mounted onto the wall using standard screws or placed in areas where monitoring is critical.

1. Select an appropriate location for installation considering the sensor's line of sight.
2. Use the provided mount bracket to screw the sensor into place.
3. Once installed, switch on the device to automatically start the monitoring process.

#### LoRaWAN Details
Am107 uses LoRaWAN technology which guarantees low power consumption and long-range communication. LoRaWAN network ensures robust, bi-directional data communication and outstanding penetration and coverage. The Am107 is compatible with LoRaWAN 1.0.2 and supports Adaptive Data Rate (ADR). 

#### Power Consumption 
As a low-power device, the Am107 can function for several years without changing batteries, in moderate conditions. This makes it a cost-effective solution for a wide range of applications. Its power efficiency is primarily due to its use of LoRaWAN technology.

#### Use Cases
With its energy-efficient, compact design, the Am107 can be effectively integrated into a vast array of applications:
- Building and home automation: Monitoring human presence and controlling lighting systems, home appliances and air conditioning systems.
- Security: Intruder detection and alarm triggering. 
- Retail and Hospitality: Person count, footfall data collection and area occupancy monitoring.
- Industrial Health and Safety: Worker presence detection and safety compliance.

#### Limitations
As efficient as the Am107 sensor is, it has some limitations:
- The maximum detection distance can be influenced by environmental conditions.
- It may not detect presence through obstacles.
- The effectiveness of the sensor may decrease with significant changes in temperature.
- Although it offers long battery life, it still needs periodic battery replacement.

In conclusion, the Am107 from Am Series offers a simplistic approach to remaining connected with critical components of your operations or residence. Its application is broad, and its installation is seamless. Yet, caution needs to be exercised when considering environmental factors that could influence the sensor's effectiveness.
