**Technical Overview: Am Series - Am104**

**1. Working Principles:**

The Am104 is a highly sensitive low-energy sensor especially designed for IoT (Internet of Things) applications. The primary function of the Am104 is to detect and monitor variables such as temperature, humidity and pressure in a given environment. It relays that information using wireless technology back to a central database, which is then processed and utilized according to user-defined specifications.

The Am104 operates on the basis of energy changes in its environment. It has micro-electro-mechanical sensors (MEMS) that absorb the different energy levels, varying from changes in temperature, humidity, or pressure, and convert that energy into electrical signals. These signals are then processed through the device and are sent to a central hub via LoRaWAN technology.

**2. Installation Guide:**

Unlike other conventional sensors, the Am104 is relatively simple to install. The unit comes with a product manual, which includes:

a. Installation of the sensor hardware
b. Configuration of software and setting up the connection to the LoRaWAN network
c. Information about maintenance and troubleshooting

Ensure the sensor is installed in its intended operational environment, away from devices emitting interference.

**3. LoRaWAN Details:**

The Am104 sensor uses LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) technology to transmit its data. LoRaWAN is a media access control (MAC) protocol for long range, low power devices. All data signals from the sensor travel via this network, ensuring the reliable and secure transmission of information over long distances.

**4. Power Consumption:**

The Am104 is designed on a low-power architecture, enabling it to operate on minimal energy levels. Generally, the sensor can work up to several years on a single set of batteries, with its power efficiency levels enhanced by the LoRaWAN, which demands very small amounts of power for the transmission of data.

**5. Use Cases:**

The Am104 sensor finds application in various industries such as agriculture, healthcare, retail, manufacturing, and more. For instance, it can be used to monitor temperature and humidity conditions in greenhouses, surgical rooms, inventory storage, and industrial processes. Data from the Am104 sensor can be used to analyze changes in environmental variables, predict future trends and control automated systems.

**6. Limitations:**

Despite its effectiveness, the Am104 has its limitations:
• The initial purchase and installation of the sensor along with the LoRaWAN system can be expensive.
• Since the sensor operates in a wireless mode, the existence of any obstruction, signal disruptions or interferences can dramatically affect its functionality.
• Data inaccuracies can occur if the sensor is not properly calibrated or maintained. 

Overall, while being a robust and reliable IoT tool, the Am104 requires careful installation, regular maintenance, and professional handling to mitigate these limitations.
