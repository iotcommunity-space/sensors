### Technical Overview: WATTECO - Triphaso Sensor

#### Introduction
The WATTECO Triphaso Sensor is a sophisticated device engineered for monitoring electrical parameters in three-phase systems. Utilizing state-of-the-art technologies, this sensor provides real-time data transmission over a LoRaWAN network, enabling efficient energy management and system diagnostics in various industrial and commercial applications.

#### Working Principles
The Triphaso Sensor operates by capturing electrical parameters such as voltage, current, power factor, frequency, and energy consumption across three phases. It leverages inductive coupling through non-invasive current transformers (CTs) and direct connection for voltage measurement. The acquired data is then digitized and pre-processed by the onboard microcontroller, transmitted securely over LoRaWAN, and presented in a readable format for monitoring and analysis.

#### Installation Guide
1. **Preparation**: Ensure that the sensor and all associated components are intact. Turn off the power supply to the installation area for safety.
2. **Sensor Placement**: Position the sensor close to the circuit breaker panel or electrical sub-meter you intend to monitor. Ensure it is placed in a dry, stable location away from any magnetic fields that could interfere with measurements.
3. **Connecting Current Transformers (CTs)**:
   - Clip each CT over the conductors of the three phases. Ensure they are properly seated and that the arrow on the CTs is pointing towards the load.
   - Securely connect the CT leads to the designated inputs on the Triphaso Sensor.
4. **Voltage Connections**:
   - Connect one end to the voltage input terminals of the sensor and the other end to the respective phase conductors. Follow the connection diagram carefully to prevent errors.
5. **Power On**: After double-checking all connections, turn the power supply back on to the system.
6. **Configuration**: Use the accompanying software or mobile application to configure network settings and ensure connectivity with the LoRaWAN gateway.

#### LoRaWAN Details
- **Frequency Band**: Operates typically within the ISM bands suitable for the region, such as EU868 for Europe or US915 for North America.
- **Data Rate and Range**: Supports data rates from DR0 to DR5, achieving communication ranges up to 15 km in rural areas, and 2 km in urban environments.
- **Network Architecture**: Functions as an end-device in the LoRaWAN network, capable of multi-channel communications with network servers.
- **Security**: Employs AES-128 encryption to ensure secure data transmission.

#### Power Consumption
The Triphaso Sensor is designed with low power consumption in mind, drawing minimal current to prolong battery life and reduce operational costs. It can be powered through mains, and in some configurations, may integrate a backup battery for uninterrupted operation.

#### Use Cases
- **Energy Management**: Ideal for monitoring energy consumption in industrial facilities, large commercial buildings, or distributed energy resources.
- **Fault Detection and Diagnostics**: Aids in identifying potential electrical faults or inefficiencies by providing real-time analytics.
- **Smart Buildings**: Enhances building management systems with granular energy usage data to optimize power distribution and consumption.
- **Utilities and Smart Grid**: Facilitates demand response programs and enhances grid reliability with precise load measurement.

#### Limitations
- **Installation Complexity**: Requires accurate installation and configuration to ensure data accuracy, making it less ideal for casual users without technical expertise.
- **Environmental Conditions**: Performance can be affected by extreme temperature variations or electromagnetic interference if not appropriately shielded.
- **Network Dependency**: Operates within the constraints of LoRaWAN coverage, which might limit usage in areas with poor signal reception.

#### Conclusion
The WATTECO Triphaso Sensor is a reliable and versatile tool for monitoring and optimizing three-phase electrical systems. While offering substantial benefits in energy management and system diagnostics, it mandates careful installation and configuration to maximize its potential. It's a critical component for modern smart infrastructure solutions, expanding capabilities through IoT integration.
