## Technical Overview of WATTECO - Humido Sensor

### Introduction
WATTECO's Humido Sensor is an advanced environmental monitoring device specifically designed to measure humidity levels in various settings. By leveraging IoT technology and operability with LoRaWAN networks, it is suited for both industrial and consumer applications, offering reliable data collection in real-time.

### Working Principles
The Humido Sensor operates by detecting ambient humidity levels using a high-precision capacitive sensor. The sensor measures the relative humidity by detecting changes in capacitance caused by moisture in the air. These changes are converted into an electrical signal, which is then processed and transmitted wirelessly.

1. **Humidity Measurement**: The core of the device comprises a capacitive transducer that responds to variations in humidity.
2. **Signal Processing**: The raw data from the humidity sensor is processed through integrated microcontroller units, filtering out noise and preparing the data for transmission.
3. **Wireless Transmission**: The processed data is transmitted over a LoRaWAN network to ensure long-range communication with low power consumption.

### Installation Guide
To ensure optimal performance, follow these steps for the installation of the Humido Sensor:

1. **Site Assessment**: Choose an environment that is representative of the overall area to be monitored.
2. **Mounting**: Use the provided mounting kit to install the sensor. It is recommended to mount the sensor at a height of 1.5 to 2 meters from the floor and away from direct exposure to sunlight, water, and extreme temperatures.
3. **Power Supply**: Insert the supplied batteries according to the polarity markings. Ensure that the battery compartment is tightly sealed.
4. **Configuration**: Set up the sensor using the accompanying configuration tool. This involves setting thresholds, calibration, and integration with your LoRaWAN network.
5. **Network Connection**: Ensure the sensor is within range of a LoRaWAN gateway. Use the network setup guide to connect the sensor to your IoT platform.
