### Technical Overview for WATTECO - Skydome Sensor

The WATTECO Skydome Sensor is a sophisticated IoT device specifically designed to monitor environmental conditions through various sensors, and relay critical data using the LoRaWAN protocol. Its compact design and reliable performance make it a valuable tool for smart city applications, agricultural monitoring, and various industrial settings.

#### Working Principles

The Skydome Sensor integrates multiple sensor types to provide comprehensive environmental data. These sensors typically include:

- Temperature Sensors: Utilize thermistors to measure ambient temperature.
- Humidity Sensors: Use capacitive humidity sensing components to gauge moisture levels in the air.
- Pressure Sensors: Employ piezoelectric components to detect changes in atmospheric pressure.
- Light Sensors: Use photodiodes for detecting luminosity.
- PIR Motion Sensors: For detecting motion within a given radius.

The data collected by these sensors is processed by an onboard microcontroller, which formats the data for transmission over the LoRaWAN network to a designated server for analysis and decision-making.

#### Installation Guide

1. **Site Selection**: Choose an unobstructed location where environmental access is necessary and ensure optimal sensor coverage.
2. **Mounting**: Use the provided mounting brackets or adhesive pads to securely affix the Skydome Sensor to a suitable surface.
3. **Power On**: The sensor is powered by a long-lasting battery. Check the battery's charge before activation.
4. **Calibration**: Some sensors may require initial calibration before use. Follow the manufacturer’s guidelines.
5. **Network Configuration**: Configure the device ID and network keys, and verify the LoRaWAN coverage and signal strength.
6. **Testing**: Conduct tests to ensure the data is being correctly transmitted to the network.
