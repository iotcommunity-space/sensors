### Working Principles
The Remote Temperature Sensor by WATTECO operates on the principle of resistive temperature sensing using a thermistor. The sensor measures the ambient temperature and converts it into a digital signal, which is then transmitted wirelessly over a LoRaWAN network. The sensor utilizes advanced filtering techniques to reduce noise and ensure accurate temperature readings.

#### Key Features:
- **Temperature Range**: Typically from -40°C to +85°C with high accuracy.
- **Resolution**: 0.1°C increments.
- **Response Time**: Fast response for dynamic temperature changes.

### Installation Guide

#### Pre-Installation:
1. **Site Selection**: Choose an appropriate location for the sensor installation, ensuring minimal exposure to direct sunlight or heat sources to avoid erroneous readings.
2. **Preparations**: Make sure all necessary tools and hardware for installation are available. Verify network coverage for optimal LoRaWAN communication.

#### Physical Installation:
1. **Mounting**: Use the provided mounting kit to secure the sensor in the chosen location. Wall mounting is recommended for stable performance.
2. **Power Supply**: Insert the batteries according to specifications. The device commonly uses AA lithium batteries for extended life.

#### Configuration:
1. **Network Configuration**: Ensure the sensor is properly configured to join the local LoRaWAN network. This includes programming the device’s Unique Identifier (DevEUI), AppKey, and AppEUI.
2. **Calibration**: Perform an initial calibration following installation using the companion software to ensure accuracy.
