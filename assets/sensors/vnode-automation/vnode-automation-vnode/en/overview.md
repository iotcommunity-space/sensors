# Technical Overview for VNODE-AUTOMATION - Vnode

## 1. Introduction
The VNODE-AUTOMATION by Vnode is an advanced IoT sensor designed specifically for seamless integration into industrial automation systems. It utilizes LoRaWAN communication to provide reliable, long-range, and energy-efficient data transmission, making it ideal for remote monitoring and control applications. 

## 2. Working Principles
The VNODE-AUTOMATION is built to monitor various environmental and mechanical parameters, including temperature, humidity, pressure, vibration, and more. This device uses built-in sensors to gather data at regular intervals based on pre-configured schedules. Data is transmitted via LoRaWAN, which allows for communication over long distances (up to 15 km in rural areas and about 5 km in urban settings) without the need for complex infrastructure.

The sensor periodically enters a low-power sleep mode between data transmission intervals to conserve energy, which is crucial for battery-operated scenarios. It features onboard intelligence to filter and preprocess the sensor data before transmission, reducing network load, and improving responsiveness.

## 3. Installation Guide

### Step 1: Pre-installation Checks
- Ensure the area of installation has adequate LoRaWAN coverage.
- Verify that the sensor placement location does not exceed the specified environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, moisture levels).

### Step 2: Physical Installation
- Mount the unit securely using the provided hardware kit or appropriate industrial fasteners on a stable surface.
- For optimal signal strength, position the device at an elevated location away from obstructions and other electronic devices that might cause interference.

### Step 3: Electrical Connections
- Connect the sensor to a DC power supply if not using battery power.
- If using external sensors or connections, ensure they are secured and shielded as per the device’s connectivity guidelines.

### Step 4: Configuration
- Use the VNODE configuration app or web interface to set up the device parameters, including measurement intervals, data thresholds, and notification settings.
- Input the Network Session Key, Application Session Key, and Device Address for LoRaWAN configuration.

### Step 5: Testing
- Perform a preliminary test once the device is installed and configured, ensuring data transmission and reception.
