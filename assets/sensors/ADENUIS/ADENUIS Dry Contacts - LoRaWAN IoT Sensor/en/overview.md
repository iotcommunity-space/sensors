**ADENUIS Dry Contacts - LoRaWAN IoT Sensor (ADENUIS) - Technical Overview**

**1. Introduction**
The ADENUIS Dry Contacts - LoRaWAN IoT Sensor is a robust, compact device designed to digitally monitor and transmit the status of equipment interfaces such as alarm systems, power systems, mechanical relays, or any binary status that operates through contact closure. Utilizing the LoRaWAN protocol, it ensures long-range and low-power consumption communication, making it an ideal solution for a variety of industrial monitoring applications.

**2. Working Principles**
The ADENUIS sensor operates by detecting changes in the state of its two dry contact inputs. Dry contacts function as binary sensors: they are either in a "closed" or "open" state. When a change in state is detected (change from open to close or vice versa), the sensor triggers an event. This event captures the state change and transmits the information wirelessly via LoRaWAN to a central system or cloud server for processing, monitoring, and alerting based on predefined conditions.

**3. Installation Guide**
- **Site Selection:** Choose a location within the operational range of a LoRaWAN gateway. Ensure the sensor is installed in an area free from extensive metal obstructions or radio interference to ensure optimal signal transmission.
- **Mounting:** Secure the sensor in place using screws or heavy-duty double-sided tape depending on the installation surface.
- **Wiring:** Connect the leads from the devices or systems you wish to monitor to the dry contacts of the sensor.
- **Configuration:** Set the sensorâ€™s transmission frequency and data intervals via a connected LoRaWAN network server. Configure alert conditions in the IoT platform you are using.
- **Testing:** Verify connectivity and correct functioning through the network backend. Check battery level and signal strength to ensure long-term operability.

**4. LoRaWAN Details**
- **Frequency:** Variable, depending on regional LoRaWAN standards (e.g., EU863-870, US902-928).
- **Network:** Needs to be within range of a LoRaWAN gateway that is connected to a network server.
- **Security:** Utilizes standard LoRaWAN encryption protocols (AES-128) to ensure secure data transfer.
  
**5. Power Consumption**
Powered by a long-life battery, unaffected by external power sources making it suitable for remote locations. The sensor is typically designed to have a low duty cycle, with periodic transmission, which significantly extends battery life typically up to several years, depending on transmission frequency and environmental conditions.

**6. Use Cases**
- **Facility Management:** Monitoring doors, windows, or other security systems to alert unauthorized access.
- **Industrial Automation:** Detecting the status of production lines or equipment.
- **Energy Management:** Monitoring power system switch status (on/off), which can help in predictive maintenance and energy saving.

**7. Limitations**
- **Range and Interference:** Transmission range can be reduced by physical obstructions or high-interference environments, typical for any radio frequency technology.
- **Battery Dependence:** Requires regular monitoring of battery level, although low power usage extends battery life.
- **Installation Environment:** Sensitive to extreme environmental conditions; not waterproof unless specified.
- **Data Limitation:** Only transmits binary (on/off) status, no analog data or more granular readings.

**Conclusion**
The ADENUIS Dry Contacts - LoRaWAN IoT Sensor provides a potent solution for remote monitoring of binary state equipment across diverse environments and applications. While considering the mentioned technical specifications and limitations, organizations can greatly enhance operational efficiency and security through real-time, automated status updates and alerts enabled by this sensor.
