### ADENUIS Analog and Power - LoRaWAN IoT Sensor (ADENUIS)

#### 1. Introduction

The ADENUIS Analog and Power LoRaWAN IoT Sensor is a robust monitoring device designed to provide real-time data acquisition in a wide range of industrial and commercial environments. Utilizing the LoRaWAN technology, this sensor offers long-range wireless connectivity to efficiently utilize analog signals and monitor power metrics.

#### 2. Working Principles

The ADENUIS sensor operates by reading analog signals from connected devices or sensors and converting these inputs into digital data. This data is then transmitted over a LoRaWAN network to an application server for analysis, monitoring, or control purposes. The sensor supports multiple channels, enabling connection to different analog inputs simultaneously.

##### Key Components:
- **Analog Input Converter:** Converts physical signals (voltage, current) to digital signals.
- **Microcontroller Unit (MCU):** Manages the sensor’s functionalities and processes data.
- **LoRaWAN Module:** Facilitates communication over LoRaWAN networks, ensuring secure and long-range data transmission.

#### 3. Installation Guide

**Pre-Requisites:**
- LoRaWAN gateway coverage
- Appropriate mounting location
- Tools for installation (depending on the fixture requirements)

**Steps:**
1. **Mounting the Sensor:**
   - Choose a secure and appropriate location that best fits the transmission and reception.
   - Ensure that the mounting location is within the LoRaWAN gateway’s range and free from physical or electronic interferences.
2. **Connecting Analog Inputs:**
   - Carefully connect the analog cables from the sensor to the output leads of the monitored devices.
   - Secure connections to prevent loosening or interference.
3. **Configuration and Provisioning:**
   - Configure the sensor using the device management platform linked with your LoRaWAN provider.
   - Set up parameter thresholds, intervals for data transmission, and connect the device to the network.

#### 4. LoRaWAN Details

- **Network Type:** LoRaWAN Class A (most common for battery-operated devices)
- **Frequency:** Varies by region (e.g., EU868 MHz in Europe, US915 MHz in the USA)
- **Data Rates:** Adjustable data rates from 0.3 kbps to 50 kbps
- **Security:** Implements end-to-end encryption using AES-128

#### 5. Power Consumption

The ADENUIS Analog and Power sensor is designed for low power consumption:
- **Sleep Mode:** Minimizes power drain when data is not being transmitted.
- **Battery Life:** Expected battery life under typical usage scenarios is up to 10 years, depending on the frequency of transmissions and environmental conditions.

#### 6. Use Cases

- **Industrial Monitoring:** Real-time monitoring of manufacturing processes.
- **Utility Management:** Monitoring and diagnostics in power generation and distribution.
- **Environmental Monitoring:** Tracking environmental parameters like soil moisture or air quality.

#### 7. Limitations

- **Distance to Gateway:** The sensor's range is dependent on environmental factors and may need repeaters in large industrial sites.
- **Analog Signal Compatibility:** Limited to specified input ranges; not suitable for high voltage or current without appropriate transducers.
- **Deployment Scale:** Depends on the number of nearby nodes due to the shared spectrum and possible data transmission interference.

#### 8. Conclusion

The ADENUIS Analog and Power sensor provides comprehensive solutions for businesses needing reliable and efficient monitoring over LoRaWAN networks. It’s essential to consider operational requirements and environmental factors when deploying to optimize performance and reliability.
