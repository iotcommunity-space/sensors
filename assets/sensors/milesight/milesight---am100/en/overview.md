## MILESIGHT - AM100 Technical Documentation

### Working Principles: 

The MILESIGHT - AM100 is a highly advanced IoT device powered by LoRaWAN® technology. Based on the principle of telemetry or remote measurement, it specializes in capturing and sending data about humidity, temperature, and light. This smart device enables data transmission over wide distances, leveraging the integration of smart sensors, gateways and IoT platforms.

### Installation Guide: 

The installation of MILESIGHT - AM100 is intuitive, requiring minimal technical expertise. 

1. Begin with the unboxing of your MILESIGHT - AM100 device. 
   
2. Position the sensor in your chosen location aligning based on the items or environments to be monitored.

3. Next, pair it with the LoRaWAN® network by following the device's user manual’s instruction.
   
4. After successful pairing, make sure the device is turned on. If done correctly, the LED signal will flash, indicating successful connection.
   
5. The device will then commence measures and send data to the chosen platform via the paired LoRaWAN gateway.

### LoRaWAN Details:

The MILESIGHT - AM100 operates using the LoRaWAN® protocol which supports long-distance data transmission in low-power applications. This permits the device to have effective connectivity over several kilometers, making it ideal for remote and inaccessible locations. The AM100 supports LoRaWAN version 1.0.2 and can function in any ISM band status depending on the region of operation.

### Power Consumption: 

Power consumption in MILESIGHT - AM100 is captivatingly low. Powered by a 19000mAh ER34615 battery, the device can stay operational for up to 10 years at a transmission rate of 30 minute intervals, thereby significantly reducing the maintenance frequency and cost.

### Use Cases:

The MILESIGHT - AM100 is versatile and finds use in a wide range of applications, including: 

1. Agri-tech: Used for monitoring temperature and humidity in greenhouses.

2. Industrial Monitoring: Used for tracking and managing conditions in factories and warehouses.

3. Cold Chain Logistics: It is adept in monitoring temperature and humidity in transportation of temperature-sensitive goods.

4. Smart Buildings: Helps in maintaining optimal conditions in residential and commercial buildings.

### Limitations: 

While the MILESIGHT - AM100 is highly versatile and robust in its operation, it does have some limitations. 

1. It's majorly dependent on LoRaWAN gateway for data transmission, posing challenges in areas with limited or no LoRaWAN coverage.

2. It doesn't use real-time communication. There might be some time-lag in data collection and transmission based on network availability and device settings.

3. The device isn't ideal for applications requiring very high data rates due to the low data rate limitations of LoRaWAN technology.

In conclusion, the MILESIGHT - AM100 provides a powerful tool for temperature, humidity, and light monitoring across numerous industries, bringing to reality the value of IoT in contemporary business settings.
