## Technical Overview - MILESIGHT Vs135 Sensor 

### Working Principles
The MILESIGHT Vs135 IoT sensor operates based on LoRa modulation technology. It utilizes the Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) technology to transmit and receive data over a wide area. The product is designed to detect and send alerts in real-time following vibrations, tilting, or movement. Pt100 wired probe, situated on the Vs135 sensor, monitors the temperature details. 

### Installation Guide
Follow the steps enumerated below to install the MILESIGHT Vs135 sensor:

1. **Location**: Choose a place that requires vibration, tilt, or motion detection.
2. **Mounting**: Secure the sensor on the desired surface using the screws provided in the package.
3. **Configuration**: Power up the device and connect it to your gateway using the MILESIGHT UG65 LoRaWAN gateway. The device should be configured according to your usage requirements by setting the necessary parameters such as notification intervals, trigger conditions, etc.
4. **Verify Connection**: Check to ensure that data transmission is operative between the sensor and the gateway.

### LoRaWAN Details
The MILESIGHT Vs135 makes use of the LoRaWAN Class A protocol. LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) technology enables low power communication over long distances. It operates in the unlicensed frequency spectrum. Through adaptive data rates (ADR), LoRaWAN enables the Vs135 sensor to communicate more data to the gateway during periods of low network congestion, and less data during periods of high network congestion.

### Power Consumption
MILESIGHT Vs135 sensor is characterized by low power consumption since it is used in an IoT setup where energy efficiency is critical. The device is powered by a 1900mAh ER14505 AA Li-SOCl2 battery, which is known for its long-standing operation. The device also includes power-saving modes and the battery's lifespan can be extended depending on the transmitting power, data rate, and alert frequency.

### Use Cases
The MILESIGHT Vs135 sensor finds its application in varied domains including:

1. **Logistics**: To monitor and notify movement and tilt of goods during transit.
2. **Construction**: To monitor vibration levels on construction sites or existing structures.
3. **Industrial**: For machine condition monitoring by detecting any unusual vibrations suggesting malfunction.

### Limitations
While the MILESIGHT Vs135 sensor is a robust device, it has some limitations:

1. The sensor operates using a non-rechargeable battery, meaning the entire device may need to be replaced once the battery lifetime is reached.
2. Signal interference may affect data transmission in areas with high electro-magnetic fields.
3. While the Vs135 is designed for long-range communication, in denser urban areas range can be limited.
4. Extreme conditions may affect the sensor readings, particularly in areas with high temperatures that exceed the rating of the Pt100 temperature probe. 

This comprehensive overview covers all fundamental aspects of the MILESIGHT Vs135 IoT sensor. Always refer and adhere to the manufacturer's documentation for handling and operational instructions to ensure optimal functioning and longevity.
