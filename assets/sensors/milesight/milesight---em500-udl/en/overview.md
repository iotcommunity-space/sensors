## MILESIGHT - EM500-UDL

### Overview 

The MILESIGHT-EM500 (MILESIGHT) is an advanced Ultra-Distance Locator sensor designed to accurately measure GPS locations, employing LoRaWAN technology for superior performance. This sensor is ideal for applications where precise positioning of assets is crucial.

### Working Principles:

The real-time location is measured using highly responsive GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, and BeiDou positioning systems. The sensor integrates a low-power consumption mechanism to extend the device's lifetime. If there are no location updates requested within a set period, the device enters sleep mode automatically to save power. 

### Installation Guide:

1. Wear safety equipment like gloves, safety glasses during the installation process.
2. Fix the mounting bracket tightly on a flat surface.
3. Position the device on the mounting, ensuring it is stable.
4. To activate the device, insert the batteries in the correct orientation. 
5. Connect the device to the network and your LoRaWAN server and test its functionality.

### LoRaWAN Details:

The sensor employs the LoRaWAN protocol Class A, offering bi-directional communication. It supports a variety of network frequencies including AU915, US915, EU868, AS923, and KR920. The network server settings can be modified for different network environments.

### Power Consumption:

The EM500-UDL is designed with power efficiency in mind. It employs a low power consumption strategy. Depending on its usage, the battery (a 19000 mAh Li-SOCl2 battery) may last up to 10 years, saving operational costs significantly. It also supports a flexible reporting mechanism to ensure efficient battery consumption.

### Use Cases:

The sensor is best utilized in scenarios where tracking and monitoring of assets across long distances is critical; for instance, marine applications, asset tracking, vehicle tracking, fleet management, and many more.

### Limitations:

1. The device should only be used within its prescribed temperature range, (-40°C to +85°C).
2. It is highly dependable on the signal/coverage strength of the LoRaWAN network in the area for performance.
3. Certain external factors like high buildings or large metal objects can interfere with GPS precision.
4. Regularly downloading large amounts of data or constant GPS tracking can reduce its long-lasting battery life.

This sensor is IP67 water and dust proof and is designed with Industrial-resistant components assuring a long-lasting life in most environments. Moreover, it is equipped with advanced technology which makes it a reliable sensor device for almost all tracking and location-related applications. Nonetheless, the some limitations should also be considered while deploying it.
