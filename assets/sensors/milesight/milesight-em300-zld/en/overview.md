# Technical Overview: MILESIGHT EM300-ZLD

## Introduction
The MILESIGHT EM300-ZLD is a sophisticated IoT sensor designed primarily for detecting water leaks. It integrates seamlessly into smart infrastructure setups to provide real-time alerts for moisture or water presence, reducing the risk of water damage. The sensor operates on the LoRaWAN protocol, ensuring long-range wireless communication and lower energy usage.

## Working Principles
The EM300-ZLD uses a capacitive sensing principle for water leak detection. It features a pair of conductive sensing pins that, when exposed to water or excessive moisture, alter their electrical characteristics, triggering a detection signal. This change is captured and processed by the sensor’s onboard microcontroller, which then transmits the data wirelessly through LoRaWAN to a designated gateway or network server.

## Installation Guide
1. **Site Selection**: Choose a location below water-prone areas like beneath pipes, sinks, or basements.
2. **Mounting**: Use the provided adhesive tape or screws to affix the sensor securely. Ensure that the sensing pads are flat against the surface where water presence is likely to occur.
3. **Activation**: Open the casing and insert the batteries (usually 2x 3V CR2450). Use the internal buttons to activate the sensor; an LED will indicate successful start-up.
4. **LoRaWAN Configuration**: Configure the device via NFC or using MILESIGHT’s IoT software tools. Align it with your network by entering your LoRaWAN credentials, which includes the device address, network session key, and application session key.
5. **Testing**: Once installed, test the system by simulating a leak and verify if alerts are sent to your network’s destinations.

## LoRaWAN Details
- **Frequency Bands**: Supports a range of sub-GHz ISM bands (e.g., EU868, US915), compatible with most regional standards.
- **Data Rate and Range**: Operates with adaptive data rates between SF7 and SF12, with maximum transmission ranges in open areas of up to 10 kilometers.
- **Network Join Mode**: Offers OTAA and ABP modes for network registration, with OTAA being recommended for security and flexibility.
- **Security**: Encrypted data using AES-128 at the network layer to ensure secure transmission from device to gateway.

## Power Consumption
The EM300-ZLD is optimized for low power operation:
- **Idle State**: Consumes about 2µA.
- **Transmission Activity**: Peak consumption during transmission is about 35mA.
- **Battery Life**: Can last up to 5 years, depending on transmission frequency and environmental conditions.

## Use Cases
- **Residential Water Leak Detection**: Protect homes from water damage by detecting leaks in areas like basements and under sinks.
- **Commercial Buildings**: Manage and monitor multiple leak points in high-risk areas such as HVAC systems or around water-intensive machinery.
- **Data Centers**: Secure sensitive electronic equipment from potential water damage due to leaks in cooling systems.
- **Warehouses**: Implement in storage facilities to detect flooding or leaks that could damage goods.

## Limitations
- **Surface Requirement**: Needs a surface where the conductive pads have direct contact with potential liquids for precise detection.
- **Environmental Conditions**: Extreme temperatures or debris can potentially affect the sensor's longevity and performance.
- **Signal Obstruction**: Walls or metallic objects can impede LoRaWAN signal strength, necessitating strategic placement.
- **Maintenance**: Requires periodic checks, especially battery replacements, although infrequent.

In summary, the MILESIGHT EM300-ZLD is a versatile, robust solution for proactive water damage prevention across a wide array of environments. Proper installation and maintenance ensure it effectively integrates with existing IoT ecosystems to provide reliable leak detection services.
