**Technical Overview for MILESIGHT - Vs133 (MILESIGHT)**

**Working Principles**
The MILESIGHT Vs133 is an IoT sensor powered by advanced LoRaWAN technology. It is specifically designed to measure vibrations and inclination in industrial environments, helping users to monitor and predict mechanical failures and imbalances.

The device operates by detecting the vibrational shift and inclination angle. It has an internal accelerometer that measures vibrations across multiple axes (x, y, and z-directions). The device also uses an internal inclinometer to measure the tilt or inclination of the object it is attached to using the principle of gravity.

The Vs133 then communicates this data to the respective gateway using the LoRaWAN networking protocol. The data can be analyzed and interpreted remotely through an end-user application to monitor the status of a machine or structure.

**Installation Guide**
The MILESIGHT Vs133 is straightforward to install. The device comes with a mounting bracket that can be easily attached to the object you want to monitor. Ensure the mounting is tight and secure. Once installed, the device should be paired with an active LoRaWAN network by connecting it with your gateway through the embedded LoRaWAN protocol. The device comes with an installation guide with step-by-step instructions to help with the installation process.

**LoRaWAN Details**
The MILESIGHT Vs133 uses the LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) connectivity protocol. This protocol is designed for wide-area networks with low power consumption, catering specifically to wireless battery-operated 'things' in a regional, national, or global network. The Vs133 operates in multiple frequencies supporting EU868, IN865, US915, AU915, KR920, and AS923.

**Power Consumption**
The MILESIGHT Vs133 is powered by two ER14505 AA Lithium batteries. The device boasts low-power consumption, making it ideal for environments where frequent battery changes would be challenging. Exact battery life will depend on how frequently the unit is set to record and transmit data.

**Use Cases**
The MILESIGHT Vs133 has a wide range of uses in various industries. It is particularly suited to predictive maintenance within the manufacturing industry where machinery conditions can often indicate forthcoming issues. The device can be used on rotating equipment like motors, pumps, fans, etc., to detect errored state before a major breakdown. With its tilt function, it can be useful in construction or civil engineering, monitoring the structural integrity of buildings, bridges, dams, etc.

**Limitations**
Although the MILESIGHT Vs133 offers advanced features, it has some limitations. The Vs133 requires a LoRaWAN coverage to operate. Therefore, lack of LoRaWAN connectivity can restrict its use. Though the device has a robust battery life, it can be a limitation in high-usage scenarios where continuous data transfer is involved. Moreover, as with other devices involving radio transmissions, physical obstacles or environmental factors may impact the signal strength and effectiveness. Finally, the accuracy of the measurement data might be inadequate for certain applications requiring extremely high precision.
