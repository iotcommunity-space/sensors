# MILESIGHT - AM107 Sensor Technical Overview

## Overview:

The MILESIGHT-AM107 sensor is an Internet of Things (IoT) device designed for environment monitoring to provide critical data in various applications. It harnesses the Low Power Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) protocol for communication, making it practical for use in remote monitoring tasks or in smart infrastructure.

## Working Principles:

The MILESIGHT-AM107 sensor works by measuring changes in the environmental variables (like temperature, humidity, and light) and wirelessly transmitting the data to a pre-configured network server over LoRaWAN protocol. The sensor features high sensitivity and reliability, ensuring accurate and speedy data translation.

## Installation Guide:

1. Carefully unbox the sensor, making sure it remains undamaged.
2. Mount the sensor in the desired location ensuring the sensor is not obstructed and is within the range of the LoRaWAN gateway.
3. Follow the manufacturer guidelines on device pairing to add the sensor to your existing network.
4. Use MILESIGHTâ€™s software to configure sensor settings, such as measurement frequency and thresholds.

## LoRaWAN Details:

MILESIGHT-AM107 communicates using LoRaWAN Class A protocol, which allows low power consumption while ensuring a wide network coverage. You can select the desired frequency band depending on geographical location. It also supports adaptive data rate (ADR) to optimize power usage and data transmission efficiency.

## Power Consumption:

The MILESIGHT-AM107, given its use of the LoRaWAN communication, is very power efficient. It is powered by a 19000 mAh ER34615 battery, ensuring a long operational life. However, the actual battery life can be influenced by many factors including the data reporting frequency and network conditions.

## Common Use Cases:

1. **Agriculture:** It can monitor various environmental variables and provide critical information to help improve farm yields.
2. **Smart Buildings:** It can monitor and send alerts in response to changes in environmental conditions like temperature, humidity, and light, which can be used for automated HVAC control.
3. **Weather Monitoring:** It offers real-time information about weather parameters for meteorological applications.

## Limitations:

1. **Coverage:** The range of this device is dictated by the coverage of the LoRaWAN network. The distance to the gateway and physical obstructions can sometimes limit functionality.
2. **Environmental Interference:** Though highly sensitive, environmental conditions can affect the sensor accuracy and efficiency.
3. **Integration Complexity:** The integration into existing IoT infrastructure might be complex for non-technical users.
4. **Battery Replacement:** Although the sensor has a high-capacity battery, once exhausted it needs to be replaced to keep the sensor operational.


Despite these limitations, the MILESIGHT-AM107 sensor offers an effective solution for environment monitoring in diverse applications while ensuring low power consumption. Its benefits far outweigh any constraints, making it a powerful tool in any IoT arsenal.
