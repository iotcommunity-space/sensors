**Technical Overview of MILESIGHT - UC11-T1 (MILESIGHT)**

**Working Principles:**

The MILESIGHT - UC11-T1 is an advanced IoT sensor that holds the operation principles of ambient temperature and humidity sensing. The sensor processes the information about temperature and humidity in its environment, which is then transmitted wirelessly to the BytesRouter, MILESIGHT Cloud, or any other IoT platform.

The UC11-T1 is powered by a 19000 mAh ER34615 battery. It uses LoRa technology, (Low-Power Long-Range Technology), that enhances the connectivity range, power consumption efficacy, and the system's capacity. 

**Installation Guide:**

1. Open the package and ensure all the items (3 screws, 1 wall anchor, 1 bracket, and the UC11-T1 sensor) are complete.
2. Select an ideal installation location; it should be safe and easily reachable.
3. Take the Bracket and fit it to the wall using the screws and the anchor.
4. Place the UC11-T1 sensor into its bracket. The LED light should be upwards.
5. Move to BytesRouter web page. Set up your sensor network by following the on-screen instructions.

**LoRaWAN Details:**

UC11-T1 employs the LoRaWAN wireless transmission technology which operates on the sub-GHz frequency bands like 868MHz or 915MHz depending on regional regulations. It supports LoRaWAN protocol Class A, providing bi-directional communication. It also offers to program LoRaWAN parameters like DevEUI, AppEUI, and AppKey, etc.

**Power Consumption:**

The UC11-T1 sensor is extremely power-efficient. Its high-capacity Lithium battery (19000mAh) provides ultra-long service time. The power consumption may vary depending on the payload size and transmission frequency, but typically it allows for a battery life of up to 10 years (assuming 25°C with 20dBm transmit power and 5 minutes sampling interval). 

**Use Cases:**

Some use cases of the UC11-T1 sensor include:

1. Industrial Monitoring: Monitoring temperature and humidity levels for various spaces such as warehouses, greenhouses, data centers, etc.
2. Property Management: used in monitoring working and living environmental conditions.
3. Agriculture: Helps in maintaining optimal conditions for growth in farming and livestock.

**Limitations:**

1. UC11-T1 must not be installed or used in places with high humidity, high dust, or where it could be immersed in water.
2. It is designed for indoor use; however, it can be used outdoors with a protective case, but it lacks a native IP rating.
3. The effective range can vary depending on the environment, with obstructions significantly reducing it.
4. Battery-replacement would require professional assistance as it's not user-replaceable. 
5. The operation temperature is -20 to 55°C; hence it may not accurately sense below or above this threshold.
