**MILESIGHT - Am104 Technical Overview**

**Working Principles**

The MILESIGHT - Am104 (AM104) is an ultra-compact LoRaWAN-based sensor designed for ambient light detection. It operates using photometric diodes that react to different levels of light in an environment. The sensor can detect a wide range of illuminance from 0 to 126,000 Lux and sends this data via the LoRaWAN network to a central system for analysis and action.

**Installation Guide**

Installation of the AM104 is quite straightforward. It comes with a wall mounting bracket and screws. First, choose a location that's exposed to the light conditions you want to monitor. Screw the bracket to the wall, and click the sensor onto the bracket. The device is powered by 2 AA batteries (included in the package) that can be inserted by rotating the device to open. For network configuration, the QR code on the device needs to be scanned and registered with the MILESIGHT network server. 

**LoRaWAN Details**

The MILESIGHT - Am104 operates as a Class A LoRaWAN device which ensures low power consumption and long-range wireless transmission. It supports diverse LoRaWAN frequency bands including EU868, US915, AU915, AS923, KR920, IN865 and RU864, addressing regional standard compliance and making it suitable for worldwide operations.

**Power Consumption**

The power consumption of the AM104 sensor is minimal. This device is designed to run for years on the two AA batteries that power it, thanks to the low-power-LORA communication technology and intelligent power management capabilities.

**Use Cases**

Given its ambient light detection capabilities, the device is perfectly suited for a range of applications. Those include:

1. Intelligent Building Automation: The sensor can trigger or adjust various electrical appliances automatically depending on the light conditions.
2. Greenhouse Management: Monitor dynamic light conditions for proper plant growth.
3. Security Systems: The device can detect a sudden change in light and relay that to a security system to trigger alarms or notifications.
4. Energy Management: It can help in optimizing the use of artificial light, helping save power consumption by utilizing natural light effectively.
  
**Limitations**

While the MILESIGHT - Am104 is a powerful and efficient device, it has some limitations:

1. The sensor experiences difficulty in detecting light conditions in extreme environments or outside its given lux range.
2. Performance can be decreased by obstructions or interference with the LORA signal.
3. Although the sensor is designed for long battery life, extensive use or extreme weather conditions can impact this expectation.
4. The device, as of now, does not offer solar charging options for continuous operation without battery replacement.
5. Ambient adjustment delays may occur due to inherent processing and wireless transmission time. 

In conclusion, the MILESIGHT - Am104 is an easy-to-use, durable, and reliable light sensor with a wide application spectrum. While bearing its limitations in mind, its advantages in power consumption, connectivity, versatility, and efficiency make it an excellent choice for various use cases.
