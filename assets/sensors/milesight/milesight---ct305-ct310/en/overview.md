**Technical Documentation For MILESIGHT - Ct305 Ct310 (MILESIGHT)**

**1. Overview**
The MILESIGHT - Ct305 Ct310 (MILESIGHT) is a highly efficient IoT sensor designed to monitor current levels in an electrical system. This device integrates LoRaWAN wireless technology thereby ensuring seamless transmission of data over large distances, supporting long-range, low-power consumption, and high network capacity ideal for IoT applications. 

**2. Working Principles**
The working principle of the MILESIGHT - Ct305 Ct310 (MILESIGHT) is based on the electromagnetic induction theory of current measurement. It contains an internal coil that interacts with the electric current passing through the monitored circuit. The current flowing induces a secondary current into the coil of the sensor, which is precisely measured and then transmitted wirelessly via LoRaWAN. 

**3. Installation Guide**
To install the MILESIGHT - Ct305 Ct310 (MILESIGHT), you need to go through three main steps:

Step 1: Mount the sensor properly onto the circuit scheduled to be monitored and connect the input/output terminals to the wires of the current.
  
Step 2: Configure the MILESIGHT - Ct305 Ct310 to your specific requirements through its user-friendly configuration interface. You can set up reporting intervals, alarm thresholds, etc.

Step 3: Finally, connect the sensor to your LoRaWAN network by specifying the appropriate LoRaWAN parameters.

**4. LoRaWAN Details**
The sensor leverages LoRaWAN Class A, supporting adaptive data rate (ADR) and numerous optional channels (depending on your region), making it highly efficient in low-power consumption. It provides bi-directional communication, with the flexibility of software programmable uplink and downlink data rates.

**5. Power Consumption**
The MILESIGHT - Ct305 Ct310 is energy efficient due to its low power consumption design. Powered by a non-rechargeable 19000mAh ER34615 battery, the sensor can operate for up to 10 years, depending on specific use, data rate, and environmental factors.

**6. Use Cases**
MILESIGHT - Ct305 Ct310 sensor is primarily used for energy management in industrial and commercial applications. This includes monitoring power consumption, detecting electrical system anomalies, and ensuring efficient energy use in factories, commercial buildings, data centres, and solar power systems, among others.

**7. Limitations**
There are a few limitations to take into consideration:

- The sensor needs a clear line of sight to communicate effectively over large distances.
- Its efficiency and functionality may decrease when used in areas with high signal interference.
- While the battery life is substantial, environmental factors and usage frequency can significantly impact it.
- The sensor readings might be influenced by other high current lines near the monitored circuit.

Despite these limitations, the MILESIGHT - Ct305 Ct310 (MILESIGHT) offers a reliable solution in comprehensive current monitoring in various fields.
