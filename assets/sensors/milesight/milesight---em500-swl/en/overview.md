Title: Technical Overview: MILESIGHT - Em500 SWL

1. OVERVIEW
The MILESIGHT - Em500 SWL is a highly innovative IoT (Internet of Things) sensor designed for smart water level monitoring applications. It uses ultrasonic sensing technology to measure the water level and transmits data to the needed networks using LoRaWAN technology.

2. WORKING PRINCIPLES
The Em500-SWL uses an ultrasonic transducer that sends out ultrasonic waves to the liquid surface. The waves travel back after hitting the liquid surface and are captured by the sensor. The water level is computed based on the time of flight of ultrasonic waves.

3. INSTALLATION GUIDE
This sensor device is incredibly easy to install and use. It comes with a sturdy casing that can be mounted directly on the vertical surface above the liquid to be monitored. Ensure it is firmly affixed and has a clear path to transmit the ultrasonic wave to the liquid surface. It should be maintained at a safe distance from the liquid surface as specified in the user manual.

4. LoRaWAN DETAILS
The Em500-SWL utilizes LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) technology to transmit the data it collects over long distances. Its application can be tailored to work under different regions (including EU868, US915, AU915, AS923, KR920, IN865), and it operates in 8 channels. You can enable Adaptive Data Rating (ADR) when conditions for network coverage are stable.

5. POWER CONSUMPTION
Powered by a 19000mAh high-capacity battery, the Em500-SWL is designed for long-term use. However, the overall power consumption depends on the transmitted data frequency and the power output in the transmission. It is capable of low power consumption and operating autonomously for up to 10 years.

6. USE CASES
Ideal for smart city, industrial, or environmental applications, the sensor can monitor rivers, reservoirs, tanks, etc. The data are uploaded to the cloud server where it can be accessed for real-time monitoring or as part of smart environmental control systems.

7. LIMITATIONS
While the Em500 SWL sensor is robust and versatile, it has some limitations. Its performance can be affected by the liquid's surface being uneven. Also, the object should not be too close to prevent the ultrasonic waves from reflecting back too soon. It requires a clear path for transmitting the ultrasonic wave into the liquid surface. Furthermore, environmental factors like high humidity, drastic pressure changes, and extreme temperatures can impact sensor's readings.

8. CONCLUSION
The MILESIGHT - Em500 SWL is an excellent solution for smart water level monitoring in various scenarios with its long battery life, wide coverage area and easy installation process. Regular maintenance and optimal installation can ensure long and efficient use.
