#### TECHNICAL OVERVIEW: MILESIGHT - Em500 Co2 (MILESIGHT)

### Overview

The MILESIGHT - Em500 Co2 sensor is an advanced, efficient and durable device designed to provide accurate data about carbon dioxide concentration levels in the atmosphere. This IoT sensor is powered by the cutting-edge NDIR (Non-Dispersive Infrared) technology, enabling it to offer high precision and stable sensing performance.

### Working Principle

At its core, the MILESIGHT - Em500 Co2 sensor employs NDIR technology which captures the infrared light that CO2 molecules absorb. The different key components of this technology — the emitting source, gas chamber, and detector— work together to detect the concentration of CO2 in the environment. The infrared light from the emitting source travels through the gas chamber to the detector. If CO2 is present, it absorbs the infrared light and the detector reads this change and translates it into a digital signal, representing carbon dioxide concentration.

### Installation Guide

1. Identify a suitable installation site bearing in mind the target region, sensor signal strength, and general safety.
2. Fix the mounting plate to the chosen installation site using screws while ensuring no electrical cables or water pipes are damaged during this process.
3. Attach the sensor to the mounting plate.
4. If necessary, adjust the sensor’s orientation to ensure optimal functionality.
5. Activate and test the sensor to confirm functionality.

### LoRaWAN Details

The MILESIGHT - Em500 Co2 sensor uses LoRaWAN (Low-Power, Wide-Area Networks) technology which provides long-range, low-power communication, and high penetration. This technology can send data from the sensor to the main network server without consuming much energy, making it an efficient method for data transmission. The device supports multiple global bands including EU868, US915, AU915, AS923, KR920, IN865, and RU864.

### Power Consumption

Power efficiency is a key feature of the MILESIGHT - Em500 Co2 sensor. It is powered by a 19000 mAh ER34615 battery which can last up to 10 years depending on the frequency of data transmission, allowing for reduced maintenance costs and increased work efficiency.

### Use Cases

This sensor can be used in various fields, including but not limited to, smart buildings, greenhouse farms, industry CO2 leakage detection, and school classrooms. It can improve general health and safety by monitoring and maintaining optimal CO2 levels in the environment.

### Limitations

-The MILESIGHT - Em500 Co2 sensor is not designed to function in environments with extreme temperatures or a high degree of humidity.
-The sensor only measures atmospheric CO2 concentration. It may not function correctly when surrounded by concentrated CO2 sources.
-The long-range transmission is subject to physical barriers; the device should be installed in areas ensuring minimal obstruction for optimal function.
