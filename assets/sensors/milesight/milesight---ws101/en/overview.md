**MILESIGHT - WS101 Overview**

**Working Principles:**

The MILESIGHT - WS101 is a high-performance wireless sensor that mainly functions on the principles of IoT (Internet of Things) technology. It monitors environmental conditions, primarily temperature and relative humidity. Through advanced radio frequency technology and built-in temperature and humidity sensors, the WS101 collects data and wirelessly transmits this information to the network server for analysis and monitoring, enabling real-time environmental conditions tracking.

**Installation Guide:**

1. **Fixation and Orientation:** The sensor should be fixed and positioned on an interior surface, away from doors, windows and other heat sources or humid spaces.
2. **Setup:** Power on the sensor and ensure that it's within range of your LoRaWAN gateway.
3. **Configuration:** The WS101 is compatible with MILESIGHT's UG65 LoRaWAN gateway. Configure them on the network server by entering the device EUI, application EUI, and application key.
4. **Deployment:** Once configured, deploy the sensor and at regular intervals, it will automatically transmit collected data to the gateway.

**LoRaWAN Details:**

The WS101 employs Low Power Wide Area Network technology (LoRaWAN), ensuring long-range connectivity with low power consumption. It offers bi-directional data communication and is compatible with LoRaWAN Class A protocol, providing robust and reliable wireless communication.

**Power Consumption:**

The WS101 boasts power efficiency - its power consumption is very low due to the advanced LoRa technology. It operates on 3.6V ER18505 AA Lithium battery, providing a lifespan of 5+ years depending on the frequency of data transmission and environmental conditions.

**Use Cases:**

The MILESIGHT - WS101 can be used across a variety of sectors, including:

- Agriculture: For monitoring the temperature and humidity conditions in farming and crop production.
- Smart buildings & homes: To maintain optimal environmental conditions.
- Data centers: To monitor and manage temperature and humidity to protect sensitive equipment.
- Museums and Archive Centers: To preserve artifacts by ensuring optimal environmental conditions.

**Limitations:**

While the WS101 offers numerous benefits, it is subject to certain limitations:

- WS101 is primarily designed for indoor applications. Thus, outdoor use may affect its efficiency.
- It relies on LoRaWAN connectivity, hence won't be effective in areas without LoRaWAN coverage.
- While boasting a long battery life, power consumption highly depends on the frequency of data transmission and environmental conditions.
- The WS101 may not be compatible with non-MILESIGHT gateways.
   
Despite these limitations, the MILESIGHT - WS101 has proved itself instrumental in the IoT field with its excellent performance, easy installation, extensive connectivity range and efficient power consumption.
