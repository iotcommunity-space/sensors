## Technical Overview of MILESIGHT - EM300-SLD

### Overview
The MILESIGHT EM300-SLD is a compact and robust IoT device specifically designed for liquid leak detection in various environments. Featuring a LoRaWAN communication protocol, this sensor allows for wide-area network coverage with low power consumption, making it ideal for scalable deployments in smart buildings, industrial applications, and more.

### Working Principles
The EM300-SLD operates on a capacitive sensing principle. The device detects the presence of liquid by measuring changes in the capacitance between the sensor's two conductive tracks. When liquid comes into contact with the tracks, the capacitance increases, triggering an alert message. This capacitive method ensures high sensitivity, durability, and reliability in leak detection.

### Installation Guide

1. **Site Selection**: 
   - Choose a location close to potential water leakage sources such as pipes, tanks, or HVAC systems.
   - Ensure that the sensor is positioned flat on the ground or at the lowest point of the potential leakage area for optimal detection.

2. **Mounting**:
   - Use the provided adhesive tape to secure the sensor on the surface if the environment is non-metallic and smooth.
   - Alternatively, use screws to mount the sensor in environments requiring a more permanent installation.
   
3. **Connectivity**:
   - Ensure the sensor is within the coverage range of your LoRaWAN network gateway.
   - Follow the device's activation procedure by registering the sensor via OTAA (Over-The-Air Activation) or ABP (Activation By Personalization) methods, as per the network configuration.

4. **Configuration**:
   - Use the provided mobile application or PC software to configure sensor settings such as reporting intervals and alarm thresholds.
   - Verify that the device is properly transmitting data to the cloud platform or monitoring system.

### Limitations

- **Environmental Constraints**: The sensor should not be submerged in water; designed strictly for leak detection.
- **Distance**: Optimal communication range may vary depending on infrastructure, building materials, and environmental interference.
- **Detection Area**: Requires careful placement to ensure that leaks do not occur outside the sensor's detection zone.
- **Operating Temperature**: Effective within a temperature range of -20°C to 60°C, limiting its use in extremely harsh conditions.

This overview should provide a foundational understanding of the MILESIGHT EM300-SLD's capabilities and deployment considerations. Proper implementation will ensure accurate liquid leak detection and further enhance operational safety and efficiency across applicable use cases.
