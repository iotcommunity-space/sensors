# Technical Overview - Milesight Uc1114 Sensor

## 1. Working Principles

The MILESIGHT UC1114 Sensor is an essential IoT device used to detect switch status, by detecting the open and close status of doors, windows, etc. It operates by utilizing a magnet and hall effect sensor, which it uses to observe changes in its magnetic field environment. When the magnetic field changes due to the activity of doors or windows, the sensor picks up this change and sends an alert.

The sensor also has a built-in temperature sensor which provides accurate temperature data, adding a layer of environmental observation for more sophisticated system controls, alarms, and processes.

## 2. Installation Guide

For optimal performance, place the sensor part on the static side of the door or window. The magnet part should be installed on the door or window's dynamic side. Ensure that you install the devices no more than 10mm apart. Avoid placing or mounting the sensor near metallic surfaces or other sources of electromagnetic interference.

The installation process is as simple as fixing the device onto the specific areas using the mounting bracket and screws provided in the device kit or adhesive tape for a less invasive setup.

## 3. LoRaWAN Details

The MILESIGHT UC1114 complies with the LoRaWAN 1.0.2 protocol, operating in frequencies ranging from 863MHz-923MHz depending on regional regulations. It features adaptive data rate (ADR) support, enhancing the balance between energy consumption, data rate, and network coverage. Its maximum transmission distance is approximately 10km in an open area.

## 4. Power Consumption

Powered by a 1/2 AA, 3.6V Lithium battery, the sensor has an incredibly energy-efficient design. It has low power consumption, extending battery life up to 10 years (depending on usage, signal strength, and environmental factors), thereby reducing maintenance needs.

## 5. Use Cases

The MILESIGHT UC1114 finds application in various domains:

1. **Home/Building Automation**: It can monitor access points, such as doors and windows, for security purposes. Moreover, it can be part of an automatic climate control system due to its temperature sensor.
   
2. **Retail**: This sensor can track the use of display cases, cold storage doors, and general entry and exit points, aiding in security and optimal temperature maintenance for perishable items.

3. **Industrial Automation**: The UC1114 will notify the system to respond when doors in crucial areas are opened or closed or when temperature thresholds are crossed.

## 6. Limitations

- The MILESIGHT UC1114 does not support remote configuration or firmware updates.
- Environmental limitations like physical obstructions can affect the range of LoRaWAN communication.
- It is not designed for humid or very high-temperature environments, which can impair the accuracy and functionality of the sensor.
- The sensor and magnet must be installed within close proximity, limiting freedom of installation somewhat.

Overall, the MILESIGHT UC1114 is an exceptional door and window sensor integrating LoRaWAN technology, conducive for a multitude of settings requiring live monitoring and controls of door and window statuses as well as ambient temperature.
