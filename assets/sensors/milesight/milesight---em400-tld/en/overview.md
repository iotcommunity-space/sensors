MILESIGHT - Em400 Tld Overview

The MILESIGHT - Em400 Tld is a high capability LoRaWAN sensor that aids in temperature and humidity monitoring. The device operates based on LoRaWAN Class A protocol, in unison with operational abilities such as adaptive data rate (ADR) and regular upstream data transmission.  

Working Principles:

The Em400 Tld works by recording the surrounding temperature and humidity conditions and transmitting this data to the assigned LoRaWAN gateway. It displays precise sensing results, thanks to its equipped high-precision SHT30 sensor chip that provides accurate recording of variables.

Installation Guide:

1. Install the battery: Slide and open the bottom cover, insert the ER14505 battery, and then close the cover.
2. Power-on: The sensor will power on upon battery installation.
3. Network join: The sensor will join the network automatically. If unsuccessful, a manual network join is possible through the "Join" button.

LoRaWAN Details:

Operating on LoRaWAN wireless communication technology, the Em400 Tld effectively broadens monitoring ranges, reduces power consumption, and enhances network capacity. LoRaWAN technology also enables bi-directional communication, allowing both transmission and reception of data, while assuring message secrecy through unique network session keys.

Power Consumption:

The Em400 Tld stands out for its low-power consumption, which is enabled by its sleep mode when not transmitting or receiving data. This mode prolongs the device's battery life, thus making it suitable for long-term use without regular battery replacement.

Use Cases:

1. Climate Control Systems: The Em400 Tld is used in HVAC systems in both residential and commercial setups. 
2. Greenhouses: It monitors temperature and humidity, ensuring optimal plant growth conditions.
3. Food & Pharmaceutical Storage: It aids in maintaining appropriate temperature and humidity to avoid spoilage or degradation of goods.

Limitations:

1. Range: While LoRaWAN technology improves the range of transmission, physical obstructions may limit the device's range.
2. Battery: The battery life, although long-lasting, may vary depending on the frequency of data reporting. Frequent reporting will result in faster battery depletion.
3. Installation Constraints: The sensor must be installed in a dry location, away from direct sunlight or rain, to ensure efficient operation and longevity.

Please adhere to the provided guide and information for efficient use of the MILESIGHT - Em400 Tld sensor. Maintenance and operational care will result in optimum and reliable performance. Ensure compliance with local regulations when deploying into LoRaWAN networks.
