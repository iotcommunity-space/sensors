### MILESIGHT - Am102 Sensor Overview 

**Working Principles**
The MILESIGHT - AM102 sensor utilizes the cutting-edge technology of Internet of Things (IOT) to realize its functionalities. The sensor adopts state-of-the-art sensor technologies in order to measure ambient temperature and humidity. Am102 specializes in collecting data and sending it to a specific destination over available networks. Reliability, accuracy, and a low margin of error typify the sensor data.

**Installation Guide**
The installation procedure of the MILESIGHT - AM102 sensor is relatively straightforward. After unpacking the device, vertically mount the sensor in your predetermined location. Remember to have it installed away from any direct radiation or any source of heat to enable accurate data collection. After placing the device in the desired location, connect it to the LoRaWAN network and configure it according to your specific requirements.
  
**LoRaWAN Details**
The MILESIGHT - AM102 sensor operates on the open-standard LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) protocol. LoRaWAN is designed to allow low-power devices to communicate with Internet-connected applications over long-range wireless connections. MILESIGHT - AM102 supports various LoRaWAN frequencies including EU868, US915, AU915, AS923, KR920, and IN865.

**Power Consumption**
MILESIGHT - AM102 sensor is designed with power efficiency in mind. It is powered by a 19000 mAh ER34615 battery, facilitating an extended working period. The power consumption level is typically around 10.3µA when in sleep mode and approximately 135.25 mA during transmission, making it an extremely power-efficient device.

**Use Cases**
MILESIGHT - AM102 sensor finds usage in a variety of environments. Common ones include warehouses where temperature and humidity require constant monitoring. Similarly, agricultural firms using smart farming techniques find the device indispensable in maintaining optimal growing conditions. Other use cases include critical infrastructure monitoring, the pharmaceutical industry for preserving medicine at recommended conditions and smart cities for climate-based data metrics.

**Limitations**
Despite the numerous advantages, the MILESIGHT - AM102 sensor has some limitations. In terms of environmental liability, sensor placement is crucial for accurate readings as it might give erroneous data if it’s in close proximity to heat sources. Also, it does not support real-time monitoring because data transmission to the LoRaWAN network occurs at set intervals. Lastly, the device operating capabilities are limited by the range of the connected LoRaWAN network. Therefore, in more remote geographical areas where network coverage may be problematic, the device's operation may be disrupted.
 
To sum up, the MILESIGHT - AM102 is an advanced LoRaWAN environmental sensor that provides accurate temperature and humidity monitoring. It's easy to install, power efficient, adaptable to various use cases but demands careful placement for precise data readings.
