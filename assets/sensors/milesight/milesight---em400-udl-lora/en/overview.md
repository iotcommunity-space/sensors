Technical Overview: MILESIGHT - Em400 Udl Lora 

**Working Principles:** 

The EM400-UDL (Ultrasonic Distance/Level Sensor) uses ultrasonic waves to determine the distance or level of a specific object or surface. It sends out the ultrasonic wave and calculates the distance based on the reflection time of the wave off the target. The measurement is immune to color, transparency, or shape and can be utilized even in transparent liquids.

**Installation Guide:**

1. Identify the ideal installation point that allows the sensor to aim directly at the object or surface to be measured.

2. Use the provided mounting bracket to mount the sensor; ensure it is secure and stable.

3. Power up the sensor and use the LED indicators to confirm if it is working properly. Solid RED means normal operation, Blinking RED means sensing, and Green indicates the transmission of the data.

4. Use a LoRaWAN gateway to connect the sensor to a network. Make sure the sensor is within the coverage range of the gateway.

5. Log in to the software application to configure the sensor settings including transmission intervals and alert thresholds.

**LoRaWAN Details:**

The sensor operates on a LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) communication protocol, also known as low power wide area network (LPWAN). It operates under EU863-870, US902-928, AU915-928, KR920-923, AS920-928, CN470-510 frequency bands and supports both adaptive data rate (ADR) and confirmed/unconfirmed messages. The device uses LoRa Spread factor from SF7 to SF12 and complies with LoRaWAN 1.0.2 and 1.0.3 protocols.

**Power Consumption:**

The device operates on a 19000 mAh Li-SOCl2 non-rechargeable battery. Power consumption is highly dependent on the transmission interval and data rate. The device, however, is designed to sustain long operational periods, typically several years, owing to its low power consumption design and the efficiency of the LoRaWAN protocol.

**Use Cases:**

The EM400-UDL sensor can be utilized in various scenarios including:

1. Waste Management: Enables the regular monitoring of waste levels in bins or containers, thus aiding municipalities and companies in creating efficient waste collection schedules and routes.

2. Agriculture: Helps in monitoring water or feed levels in tanks, making it invaluable for irrigation systems, feed supply chains, etc.

3. Industrial Manufacturing: Monitors fluid levels in silos, tanks, and containers to ensure optimal levels are maintained at all times.

**Limitations:**

1. Due to its dependency on wireless connectivity, the sensorâ€™s performance can be affected by obstacles in its data transmission path. Therefore, it is best to assess the wireless signal strength while installing the sensor.

2. The device operates on a non-rechargeable battery, which, although long-lasting, will need to be replaced eventually. Users should regularly check the battery status to avoid interrupted service.

3. It is not suitable for highly volatile or corrosive environments as this could damage the sensor or affect its accurate functioning.

4. The device can only detect the level or distance of stationary or slow-moving objects. It is not appropriate for objects moving at high speed.

Overall, EM400-UDL is a reliable and efficient device designed to operate optimally in a wide variety of environments for long periods without the need for regular maintenance, making it an excellent choice for remote monitoring applications.
