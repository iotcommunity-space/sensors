**Technical Overview of MILESIGHT Ws202**

The MILESIGHT Ws202, manufactured by MILESIGHT, is an innovative sensor that leverages advanced Internet of Things (IoT) and LoRaWAN technology to support various domestic and industrial applications. The sensor is designed to efficiently measure and transmit data about environmental parameters, especially temperature and humidity.

**Working Principles**

The MILESIGHT Ws202 primarily operates on the principles of digital data acquisition and wireless data transmission. It uses a high-accuracy built-in SHT30 sensor chip to measure the temperature and humidity. The sensor collects data samples, translates them into digital signals, and then transmits them to a corresponding LoRaWAN gateway using its RF module.

**Installation Guide**

Installation of the MILESIGHT Ws202 is a relatively straightforward procedure. 

1. Start by fixing the sensor at a suitable location where it can effectively monitor the environment.
 
2. Connect it with a suitable power source, which could be a USB connection or batteries depending on your requirements.
  
3. For best performance, set the sensor at a height of about 1.5m away from any direct sunlight or high-heat sources.
 
4. Once installed, integrate the sensor with your LoRaWAN network server by following the device’s manufacturer instructions.

**LoRaWAN Details**

The MILESIGHT Ws202 is LoRaWAN Class A compatible and operates on multiple frequency ranges, including EU433, CN470, EU868, US915, AU915, and more. Being based on LoRaWAN, this sensor presents the advantages of wide coverage, low power consumption, and high network capacity. 

**Power Consumption**

The MILESIGHT Ws202 is designed for low power consumption, extending the life of its battery under normal usage conditions. The device operates in different modes—such as measurement mode, transmission state, sleep mode—that affect its power consumption. The low power consumption, combined with LoRaWAN technology, makes it a perfect fit for IoT implementations.

**Use Cases**

MILESIGHT Ws202 is applicable in numerous scenarios. It has been widely used in sectors like agriculture for crop monitoring, home automation for maintaining desirable environmental conditions, and in industries for overseeing production processes. Furthermore, it is effective in server rooms, museums, greenhouses, and wine cellars - any space where keeping temperature and humidity within certain parameters are crucial.

**Limitations**

Despite its versatility and high data accuracy, the MILESIGHT Ws202 may face minor limitations. First, positioning the sensor in direct sunlight or near heat sources can affect its accuracy. Second, for it to function appropriately, the sensor should remain within LoRaWAN network coverage. In situations of low or zero network coverage, the device's function might be compromised. Lastly, the sensor's reliance on battery power could be an issue in an environment that requires constant long-term monitoring where regular maintenance is an issue. However, a mains powered variant is available.
