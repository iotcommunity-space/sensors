Title: Technical Overview for MILESIGHT - Ct101 

1. **Working Principles:**
MILESIGHT - Ct101, with the cutting-edge LoRaWAN technology, uses AC Current Sensor to evaluate the current of cables or wires and transform it into an output signal processed. This output signal can then be analyzed for monitoring and controlling applications. 

The Ct101 operates on alternating current (AC) principle that measures the current passing through the wire by detecting the magnetic field around it. This principle allows it to produce an accurate and reliable measurement of current flow without needing to be directly connected to the high-voltage parts of a system. 

2. **Installation Guide:**
The Ct101 is designed for easy installation. Disconnect the power source before installing. Open the jaws of the sensor & clip it onto the wire you hope to measure. After properly closing the jaws, connect the Ct101 to the Milesight EM500 series end node using the supplied cable. Once installed, reconnect the power source.

3. **LoRaWAN Details:**
MILESIGHT - Ct101 uses LoRaWAN technology for communication. LoRaWAN provides a high capacity, long range and power-efficient radio spectrum usage. It can efficiently manage and control the network with ADR (Adaptive Data Rate) algorithms. Ct101 offers LoRaWAN Class A and frequency hopping spread spectrum technology to ensure secure and reliable data transmission over long distances with minimal power consumption.

4. **Power Consumption:**
One of the significant features of Ct101 is its low power consumption. Due to the nature of LoRaWAN technology, the device uses power only when itâ€™s communicating, enabling it to have a long battery life. The exact power consumption depends on the frequency and amount of data transmissions.

5. **Use Cases:**
The MILESIGHT - Ct101 is suitable for a range of applications, including industrial automation, intelligent buildings, and real-time energy monitoring. Furthermore, it can be utilized in a variety of sectors, including the manufacturing industry, energy industry, utility services, and smart home applications. 

6. **Limitations:**
While the MILESIGHT - Ct101 is a versatile device, it also has certain limitations. It is designed to measure AC current only, not DC. It also can't measure voltage. The device needs to be within a certain range of the LoRaWAN gateway to communicate effectively. Its performance can also be affected by numerous factors including, but not limited to, the amount of data sent, the surrounding radio and environmental conditions, and the battery's condition.

In conclusion, MILESIGHT - Ct101 is an adept sensor, proficient in detecting and measuring the current in wires and cables. Despite its few limitations, its easy installation, power efficiency, and versatility make it an excellent device for various industrial and domestic applications.
