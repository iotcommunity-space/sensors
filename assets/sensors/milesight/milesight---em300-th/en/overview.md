**MILESIGHT EM300-TH Technical Overview**

**Working Principles:**

The MILESIGHT EM300-TH is an advanced IoT sensor specifically designed to measure environmental temperature and humidity. This cutting-edge device operates using a built-in high-precision sensor to accurately gauge a wide range of temperature and humidity levels. It collects data from the surrounding environment, analyzes the inputs, and then transmits the information via LoRaWANTM Class A protocol.

**Installation Guide:**

Installation of the MILESIGHT EM300-TH is straightforward and can be completed within a few steps:

1. First, select a suitable location that requires temperature and humidity monitoring.
2. Ensure that the site is free from any obstructions that could potentially interfere with the sensor readings.
3. Use the mounting bracket provided in the package to securely fix the device onto a flat surface or a DIN rail.
4. To power up the device, pull off the insulation strip at the rear side. The LED indicator starts blinking green, signifying that the device is up and running.

**LoRaWAN Details:**

MILESIGHT EM300-TH operates on LoRaWAN Class A protocol which ensures optimal power efficiency and long-range transmission of information. The device supports various data transmission rates, and adaptive data Rate (ADR) to optimally balance power consumption and data transmission delay. LoRaWAN also employs advanced encryption techniques (128-bit AES) to securely transmit the data to the network server.

**Power Consumption:**

The sensor operates on a 19000mAh Li-SOCI2 battery, providing ultra-low power consumption and long battery life of up to 10 years depending on the data transmission interval and network conditions. The sensor gleans data and enters into sleep mode between transmissions, saving significant power.

**Use Cases:**

The MILESIGHT EM300-TH can serve a myriad of applications needing accurate temperature and humidity monitoring. Some typical use cases include:

1. Smart Agriculture: Soil moisture and ambient temperature can determine the growth of crops.
2. Industrial Controls: Tracking and controlling the humidity and temperature in compliance with the manufacturing needs.
3. Greenhouse Management: Ensuring the required climate is maintained.
4. Server Room monitoring: Prevention of equipment failure due to temperature and humidity variation.
5. Smart Building & HVAC: Maintain comfortable and energy-efficient environments.

**Limitations:**

While the EM300-TH excels in various situations, it does have a few limitations:

1. Distance: As a low-range and low power IoT device, the EM300-TH’s signal might be hampered by obstructions or long range.
2. Environment: Its operation might be affected in extremely cold or hot conditions.
3. Interference: Strong electrical or magnetic fields may interfere with the device’s operation. 
4. Measuring Range: The device has a limited temperature (-30°C to 60°C) and humidity (10% to 90% RH) measuring range.
5. Battery: The battery life can be shortened if the data transmission interval is set too frequently.
   
Remember to follow all safety and installation instructions to ensure the optimal performance of the MILESIGHT EM300-TH. For best results, update the device firmware and software regularly from the official MILESIGHT website or authorized dealers.
