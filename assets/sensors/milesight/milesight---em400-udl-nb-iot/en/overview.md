## Technical Overview: MILESIGHT - Em400 Udl Nb Iot (MILESIGHT)

### 1. Working Principles
The MILESIGHT-EM400 UDL NB IoT operates by collecting data via its suite of sensors and transmitting the collated data over the NB-IoT network (NB stands for Narrowband). The NB-IoT provides low power wide area technology that enables connectivity for IoT devices. This unit utilizes a suite of various sensors like light, temperature, and humidity sensors. With the integrated NB-IoT module, it supports efficient and cost-effective data transmission.

### 2. Installation Guide
The MILESIGHT-EM400 can be installed quickly and easily.

- Begin by powering up the device with a primary 19000mAh Li-SOCL2 battery.
- Connect the battery connectors and make sure it's secured.
- Place the IoT device in the desired location where the sensors can effectively collect data.
- Connect the device to the NB-IoT network.

Remember to verify the network signal strength and ensure that the IoT device is properly connected and functioning as expected.

### 3. LoRaWAN Details
While the primary communication technology for the EM400 is the NB-IoT network, it also supports LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network). This is a protocol for low-power wide-area networks designed for IoT devices. The device uses a LoRaWAN Class C device implementation. Its data rate and frequency bands are customizable based on regional regulatory compliance.

### 4. Power Consumption
The MILESIGHT-EM400 is characterized by low power consumption due to its utilization of NB-IoT technology. The device is powered by a 19000mAh Li-SOCL2 battery, which can ensure years of battery life. This ensures a prolonged lifespan of the device and reduces the need for regular battery replacements.

### 5. Use Cases
The MILESIGHT-EM400 serves versatile use cases which include:

- Environments that required periodic data updates like in weather stations.
- Application in smart agriculture for monitoring light, temperature, and humidity conditions.
- Smart buildings that need regular monitoring of a variety of parameters.
- It's also used in industrial control systems that require high reliability and efficient data transmission.

### 6. Limitations 
The MILESIGHT-EM400, whilst a highly versatile and efficient device, does have a few limitations:

- Limited connectivity range: The NB-IoT network coverage is still improving, so connectivity could be a limitation in certain locations.
- Limited upgradeability: The device software is not easily upgradeable.
- Fixed sensors: Sensors cannot be changed or added to the device. It only supports sensors that come with the device.
  
Despite these, its advantages significantly outweigh these limitations making it a valuable asset within the IoT landscape.
