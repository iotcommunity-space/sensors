Title: Technical Overview of MILESIGHT-EM500-PP Sensor

1. Working Principles:
The MILESIGHT-EM500-PP sensor is IoT-enabled equipment specifically designed for environmental monitoring. It utilizes LoRaWAN protocol to connect and convey data. The sensor measures atmospheric pressure, temperature, and humidity (PTH), from which it derives dew point, heat index, and absolute humidity values. The data is then processed and sent to the configured LoRaWAN gateway.

2. Installation Guide:
Installation of the EM500-PP sensor device is relatively easy. To begin, ensure the buttoned side of the device faces upwards. Use the in-built mount to attach it to the desired location. Ensure the device is installed upright, in a cool and dry place with no direct exposure to sunlight. Connect it to the LoRaWAN network by pressing and holding the set key until the LED flashes blue. After you've done this, your sensor device is ready for use.

3. LoRaWAN Details:
The sensor operates on the LoRaWAN protocol, a long-range, low-power wireless platform of significant value in IoT networks worldwide. It supports frequency bands for EU868, US915, AU915, AS923, KR920, and IN865.

4. Power Consumption:
The EM500-PP sensor boasts remarkable power efficiency with an average power consumption of just 0.04W. The built-in 19000mAh Li-SOCl2 battery ensures a lengthy device lifespan of more than 10 years (under normal usage).

5. Use Cases:
The sensor is principally used in weather and environmental monitoring applications. It can be used in smart agriculture for climate control, greenhouse monitoring, and crop management. In smart cities, it helps in weather prediction and monitoring air quality. Industrial applications include production environment monitoring and data center environmental monitoring. This sensor is also applicable in pedestrian/vehicular tunnels for air quality monitoring to ensure safety standards are met. 

6. Limitations:
Despite its comprehensive utility, the EM500-PP sensor also has a few limitations. The device may not perform with optimal accuracy when placed in extremely humid or excessively hot regions. Simultaneously, regions with exceptionally harsh weather can affect the durability of the device. The sensor's communication may be hindered by physical obstructions and some materials, contributing to signal loss. Lastly, the sensor operates within specified transmission distances, and stretching beyond it may lead to data loss or inaccuracy.

In conclusion, the MILESIGHT-EM500-PP sensor with its advanced features and applications bridges a significant gap in environmental monitoring systems. However, its applications should be carried out within the mentioned limitations to ensure its durability and effectiveness. The huge energy efficiency and potential for seamless integration into any IoT framework makes this device a promising piece of technology.
