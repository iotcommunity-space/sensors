# MILESIGHT TS30X Technical Overview

The MILESIGHT TS30X series is a range of advanced LoRaWAN temperature sensors designed to provide reliable and accurate environmental monitoring. These sensors are ideal for applications needing precise temperature data in diverse environments. 

## Working Principles

The MILESIGHT TS30X sensor operates on the principle of thermocouple or thermistor technology to detect temperature changes. It is equipped with an embedded sensor that measures ambient temperature, which is then converted into an electrical signal and transmitted via LoRaWAN to a central station or cloud server for analysis and monitoring.

### Key Features:
- **High Precision**: Offers accurate temperature readings with minimal deviation.
- **Wide Temperature Range**: Suitable for a broad spectrum of environments.
- **Long Range**: Utilizes LoRaWAN technology for long-distance data transmission.

## Installation Guide

1. **Pre-Installation Setup**:
   - Ensure that the sensor and LoRaWAN gateway are compatible and are within the operational range.
   - Confirm that the application server is appropriately configured to receive data from the TS30X.

2. **Physical Installation**:
   - Mount the sensor at the desired location using the provided brackets and screws.
   - Ensure that the sensor is positioned away from direct heat sources or cooling vents to avoid inaccurate readings.

3. **Power Source**:
   - Insert the battery (check specific model for battery type). Ensure proper insertion and orientation.
   - The sensor may also support external power sources — refer to the manual for specific voltage requirements.

4. **Configuration**:
   - Use the provided configuration tool or application to set the operation parameters such as data transmission intervals and alarm thresholds.
   - Connect the sensor to the LoRaWAN gateway by following pairing instructions specific to your network requirements.

5. **Verification**:
   - Once installed, perform a series of test measurements to verify operational accuracy.
   - Ensure data is being properly received and interpreted by the central system.

## LoRaWAN Details

- **Frequency Bands**: The TS30X supports various frequency bands worldwide, including EU868, US915, AU915, AS923, CN470, etc.
- **Data Rate**: Typically operates with LoRaWAN data rates ranging between DR0 to DR5, depending on the specific regional frequency plan.
- **Communication Range**: Can achieve effective communication over several kilometers in open areas, subject to environmental conditions and network configuration.
- **Security**: Utilizes AES-128 encryption to ensure secure data transmission.

## Power Consumption
