## Technical Overview for MIOTIQ - Custom Miotiq

### Introduction
MIOTIQ - Custom Miotiq is a versatile IoT sensor designed for various applications across industries that require low-power, long-range wireless communication. It leverages LoRaWAN technology to enable long-distance data transmission with minimal energy consumption.

### Working Principles

#### Sensor Functionality
MIOTIQ sensors can be customized with various sensing capabilities such as temperature, humidity, motion, and environmental monitoring. These sensors operate by continuously measuring environmental or physical parameters, converting these measurements into electrical signals, and processing them for wireless transmission via LoRaWAN.

#### Communication via LoRaWAN
LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) is a protocol developed for low-power, wide-area networks. It operates in license-free sub-gigahertz frequency bands, such as 868 MHz (Europe) and 915 MHz (North America), allowing MIOTIQ to transmit data over several kilometers in rural areas and up to a few kilometers in urban environments.

### Installation Guide

1. **Site Assessment:**
   - Ensure an appropriate location for installation, considering factors like distance from the gateway, potential obstacles, and environmental conditions.

2. **Hardware Setup:**
   - Securely mount the MIOTIQ sensor using provided brackets or a custom fixture.
   - If necessary, attach external sensor probes or connections according to the specific application requirements.

3. **Power Management:**
   - Insert batteries or connect to a power source. Ensure that primary lithium batteries or a compatible power supply is used for optimal performance.

4. **Network Configuration:**
   - Use the MIOTIQ configuration tool to set device parameters such as data transmission intervals and sensor thresholds.
   - Register the device on a LoRaWAN network server by inputting the DevEUI, AppEUI, and AppKey credentials. Ensure the device is properly connected to the network and is transmitting data.

5. **Testing and Calibration:**
   - Perform initial tests to confirm sensor readings are accurate and that data is being received by the network server.
   - Calibrate sensors if necessary according to application specifications.

### LoRaWAN Details

- **Frequency Bands:** MIOTIQ operates on frequency bands such as 868 MHz (EU) and 915 MHz (US/Australia).
- **Data Rates:** Supports LoRaWAN data rates from DR0 (min, SF12) to DR5 (max, SF7).
- **Security:** Leverages AES-128 encryption ensuring secure data transmission.
- **Join Type:** Supports OTAA (Over-The-Air Activation) for initial device provisioning.

### Power Consumption

MIOTIQ is engineered for ultra-low power consumption, making it suitable for battery-operated applications where frequent maintenance is not feasible:

- **Idle State:** Power consumption is in the microampere range.
- **Active Transmission:** Consumes more power during data transmission, typically in milliamps, but only for brief periods due to LoRaWAN's low-duty cycle.
- **Battery Lifespan:** With typical use, batteries can last several years, under conditions of daily data transmission and optimal network conditions.

### Use Cases

1. **Environmental Monitoring:** Track climate variables like temperature and humidity in agriculture or greenhouses.
2. **Industrial IoT:** Monitor machine states and environmental conditions in manufacturing facilities.
3. **Smart Cities:** Deploy sensors for air quality monitoring, waste management, and urban infrastructure monitoring.
4. **Asset Tracking:** Monitor the location and movement of goods in logistics and supply chains.

### Limitations

- **Data Rate and Latency:** LoRaWAN's low data rate is not suitable for applications requiring high-bandwidth or real-time data.
- **Range Limitations:** Despite its long range, dense urban environments can hinder LoRa performance due to buildings and other obstacles.
- **Transmission Duty Cycle Constraints:** Regulatory compliant duty cycle limits may restrict how often sensors can transmit data.
- **Interference and Noise:** The unlicensed frequency bands are subject to interference, which can affect signal quality and reliability.

### Conclusion
The MIOTIQ - Custom Miotiq sensor provides a robust, low-power solution for various IoT applications that require long-range wireless communication. While it excels in cost-effectiveness and battery efficiency, users should consider its limitations regarding data rate and signal interference when planning deployments. Proper installation, configuration, and network planning are critical to achieving optimal performance.
