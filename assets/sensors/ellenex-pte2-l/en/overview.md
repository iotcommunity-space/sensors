### Technical Overview for ELLENEX - Pte2 L

#### Introduction

The ELLENEX Pte2 L is a robust and versatile pressure and temperature sensor designed for industrial Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Specifically engineered to integrate seamlessly with LoRaWAN networks, this device is ideal for remote monitoring applications, providing long-range communication capabilities through low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) technology.

#### Working Principles

The ELLENEX Pte2 L operates on the principles of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology for pressure measurement and a highly sensitive thermistor for temperature sensing. The pressure sensor detects the force exerted by fluid or gas per unit area, converting it into an electrical signal. Simultaneously, the thermistor measures temperature changes, allowing for comprehensive environmental monitoring. These sensors offer precision with high accuracy and stability over a wide range of environmental conditions. Data collected by these sensors are packaged and transmitted via LoRaWAN for real-time analysis.

#### Installation Guide

1. **Pre-Installation Checks:**
   - Verify all components are present and undamaged.
   - Ensure compatibility with existing systems and LoRaWAN gateways.

2. **Environment Consideration:**
   - Install in areas free from extreme temperatures, harsh chemicals, or direct sunlight.
   - Ensure the installation site is within range of a LoRaWAN gateway.

3. **Mechanical Installation:**
   - Use appropriate fittings and mountings to secure the sensor in the desired orientation.
   - Connect the sensor to the system using standard BSPT or NPT thread options for fluid or gas interfaces.

4. **Electrical Installation:**
   - Ensure the power source is isolated before connection.
   - Follow the wiring diagram to connect the sensor correctly to the power supply.

5. **Network Configuration:**
   - Use the manufacturer's configuration tool to set up the LoRaWAN parameters including DevEUI, AppEUI, and AppKey.
   - Join the sensor to the LoRaWAN network through OTA or ABP activation.

6. **Calibration and Testing:**
   - Calibrate the sensor using the ELLENEX software interface.
   - Test the sensor to confirm correct pressure and temperature readings are transmitted.

#### LoRaWAN Details

- **Frequency Bands:** Supports global ISM bands, including EU868, US915, and AS923.
- **Communication:** Bi-directional communication to send collected data and receive remote control commands.
- **Security:** Uses AES-128 encryption to ensure data integrity and confidentiality.
- **Network Activation:** Supports both Over-the-Air (OTA) and Activation-by-Personalization (ABP).

#### Power Consumption

The ELLENEX Pte2 L is designed for low power consumption, optimized for battery operation:

- **Sleep Mode:** Draws less than 10 µA.
- **Active Transmission:** Consumes approximately 25 mA.
- **Battery Life:** Designed to operate for up to 10 years on a single battery under optimal conditions with a standard transmission interval.

#### Use Cases

- **Water Management:** Monitoring water pressure and temperature in water treatment plants, pipelines, and distribution networks.
- **Industrial Processes:** Used in manufacturing to oversee system pressures and temperatures ensuring optimal operation and safety.
- **Environmental Monitoring:** Deployed for weather stations and agricultural applications to monitor hydro-meteorological data.

#### Limitations

- **Signal Range:** Effectiveness is contingent on proximity to LoRaWAN gateways. Urban environments may experience reduced range due to interference.
- **Operating Temperature:** The device is limited to environments within its specified temperature range of -40°C to +85°C.
- **Data Transmission:** Limited by LoRaWAN duty cycles, which can affect data update rates in higher frequency scenarios.

In summary, the ELLENEX Pte2 L offers a reliable and efficient solution for remote pressure and temperature sensing in a wide array of industrial applications, with the advantage of LoRaWAN technology enabling long-range, low-power communication. However, careful consideration of installation environment and network availability is crucial to fully leverage the sensor's capabilities.
