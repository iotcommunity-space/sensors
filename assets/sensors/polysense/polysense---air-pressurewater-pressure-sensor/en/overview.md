# POLYSENSE - Air/Water Pressure Sensor 

## Overview

POLYSENSE air/water pressure sensor is an advanced IoT device designed to measure atmospheric and water pressures accurately in a wide range of environments. This sensor leverages LoRaWAN communication technology to provide long-range data transfer capabilities while conserving power, making it an ideal choice for many IoT use cases.

## Working Principles

The POLYSENSE sensor operates based on piezoelectric principles. The pressure being measured applies force on a piezoelectric crystal inside the sensor which generates an electrical charge proportional to the force. This charge amplitude is interpreted by the sensor system as different pressure levels. 

The device then uses its embedded controller to convert this raw measurement into useful data, which is then transmitted back to a central system or gateway via the LoRaWAN network.

## Installation Guide

1. Select an appropriate location based on operation needs. Make sure the selected site is within the LoRaWAN network range. 
2. Mount the sensor as per requirement - on a pipeline for water pressure or on an open platform for air pressure. Ensure it is firmly attached to prevent unexpected movement.
3. Connect the POLYSENSE sensor to the power source. If using batteries, make sure they are correctly installed and fully charged.
4. Set the desired parameters and behavior according to your application on the device or via the LoRaWAN network.
5. Once it's mounted and properly setup, the sensor will start transmitting pressure data back to the gateway or central hub of the LoRaWAN network.

## LoRaWAN Details

The POLYSENSE sensor uses LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) technology for data transmission. It operates in the unlicensed radio spectrum and uses a spread spectrum modulation for communication. This gives it its long range (up to 15km in rural areas) and low power consumption properties. The device's frequency operation will depend on the regional LoRaWAN regulations.

## Power Consumption

POLYSENSE air/water pressure sensor is designed to work with low power consumption, making it suitable for applications where continuous power supply may not be guaranteed. Although the exact power usage varies based on the specific conditions and frequency of data transmission, the sensor's sleep mode and LoRaWAN's power efficiency contribute significantly to giving the device a long battery life.

## Use Cases

The sensor can be used in multiple scenarios such as:

1. Weather Stations: It can monitor atmospheric pressure to forecast weather and climate changes.
2. Industrial Settings: Used to monitor hydraulic or pneumatic pressure.
3. Water management facilities: It measures water pressure in pipelines which can be used for leak detection or monitoring supply flow.

## Limitations

While POLYSENSE air/water pressure sensor is a powerful device, it has a few limitations:

1. The sensor operates within a specific pressure range on both ends. It is not suitable for extremely high or low-pressure applications.
2. Being a wireless device, it might face interference or obstacles that could limit the effective range of transmission.
3. The battery lifetime might be affected by the frequency of data transmission and the environmental conditions.
4. The sensor requires a LoRaWAN gateway within range to successfully transmit data.
