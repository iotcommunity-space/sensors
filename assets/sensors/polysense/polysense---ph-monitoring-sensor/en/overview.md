## POLYSENSE - Ph Monitoring Sensor Technical Overview

### Working Principle

The POLYSENSE Ph Monitoring Sensor operates based on the ion-selective electrode method. The sensor consists of a sensing electrode (also known as a PH electrode) and a reference electrode. The sensing electrode is sensitive to the hydrogen ion activity in the solution whose PH needs to be measured. This electrode generates a potential (electrostatic charge) corresponding to the PH value that creates an electromotive force (EMF). The reference electrode offers a constant potential. The potential difference between these two electrodes is measured and analysed by the built-in microcontroller to provide a PH value which is then transmitted over the network.

### Installation Guide

1. **Mounting the Device**: Ensure the installation site is clean and secure. Mount the sensor device using the provided mount kit.

2. **Connecting the Probes**: Connect the pH probe to the corresponding port on the sensor. Ensure the connections are tight and secure to prevent leakage and interference.

3. **Configuration**: Connect the sensor to a computer system using a USB cable for initial setup and configuration, which includes setting up necessary network parameters, calibration, and choosing the operating mode.

4. **Powering up**: After successful configuration, power up the device.

5. **Deploying into Application**: Place the pH probe into your desired measurement point. Ensure the probe is fully submerged in the solution to yield accurate results.

### LoRaWAN Details

The POLYSENSE Ph Monitoring Sensor uses LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) for communication. It operates in any of the LoRaWAN frequency bands, which ranges from 433 to 923 MHz. LoRaWAN provides low-power, long-range wireless communication which is suited for IoT devices like this sensor. The sensor supports the latest LoRaWAN 1.0.3 protocol which ensures compatibility with a wide range of LoRa network servers.

### Power Consumption

The Polysense pH Monitoring Sensor is highly energy-efficient due to its low power consumption design. The power consumption mainly depends on the transmission cycle. When set to a 15-minute measurement and a transmission cycle, a 3.6V/19000mAh battery can last up to 10 years.

### Use Cases

1. **Water Treatment Plants**: To monitor the pH levels of water during the treatment process. 

2. **Agriculture**: To examine the pH level in soil for better crop yield.

3. **Chemical Industries**: Monitoring pH in various chemical reactions.

4. **Pharmaceutical industries**: Maintaining pH control in drug manufacturing.

5. **Food and Beverage Industries**: Checking the pH level of food products to meet health and safety standards.

### Limitations 

1. **Probe Maintenance**: The pH probe needs regular cleaning and calibration in order to maintain accuracy. 

2. **Temperature Affect**: pH readings are temperature-dependent, thus require temperature compensation for accurate measurements.

3. **Signal Interference**: Being a LoRaWAN device, it might face interference from devices operating on the same frequency.

4. **Longevity**: The electrodes in the probe wear out over time; hence, they need to be replaced periodically to keep the device functioning efficiently.

In conclusion, the Polysense pH Monitoring Sensor efficiently performs pH monitoring tasks in a variety of industries while leveraging LoRaWAN for reliable long-distance communication.
