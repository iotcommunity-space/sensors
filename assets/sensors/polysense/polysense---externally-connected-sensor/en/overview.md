## POLYSENSE - Externally Connected Sensor (POLYSENSE)

### Overview
POLYSENSE sensor is an advanced, versatile, and externally connected LoRaWAN sensor designed to capture, process, and transmit data from diverse environments. It provides actionable insights by converting physical phenomena into a format that IoT applications can understand and use.

### Working Principles

The POLYSENSE sensor operates based on the principles of Machine-to-Machine (M2M) and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. It integrates different types of sensing modules that operate concurrently to measure parameters such as temperature, humidity, light intensity, pressure, movement, and other environmental data.

Once the data is captured, the sensor utilises LoRaWAN (Low Range Wide Area Network) communication technologies to convert and transmit the data in real-time back to a centralised server or base station. This data can then be monitored, analysed and utilised to drive informed decision making.

### Installation Guide

1. Select a suitable location to install the sensor. The chosen site should have good LoRaWAN connectivity and should be close to the environmental parameters to be monitored.
2. Securely mount the sensor using the hardware provided, ensuring it is stable and not likely to move.
3. Connect the sensor to the power source (battery/solar power).
4. Connect the sensor to the LoRaWAN network by following the manufacturer's instructions on the sensor's user manual.
5. Check and ensure the sensorâ€™s operation and connectivity to the network.

### LoRaWAN Details

POLYSENSE takes advantage of LoRaWAN, a standard for wireless communication that allows IoT devices to communicate over long distances with minimal power consumption. It operates in the unlicensed radio spectrum, making it cost-effective and provides deep penetration in dense urban and indoor areas and broad coverage in rural areas. 

### Power Consumption

POLYSENSE sensors are highly energy-efficient and optimised for low power consumption. This makes them suitable for battery-operated or solar-powered applications where energy efficiency is important. The exact power consumption may vary depending on the operating conditions and the specific functionality of the sensor.

### Use Cases

POLYSENSE is suitable for a number of IoT applications, including:

1. Environmental Monitoring: Measuring and reporting environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity and light.
2. Smart Farming: Tracking soil conditions, air quality, weather conditions and plant health.
3. Industrial IoT: Monitoring machine data to predict maintenance needs, improve operational efficiency and reduce downtime.
4. Smart Cities: Measuring air quality, noise levels, and various other environmental parameters in urban areas.

### Limitations

While POLYSENSE sensors are highly versatile, there are several considerations:

1. They require a stable LoRaWAN connection to operate effectively. Network gaps may disrupt data transmission.
2. The range of sensing capabilities may be limited by the physical properties of the environment in which they are installed.
3. It might not work effectively in environments with high RF interference.
4. High temperature extremes may affect sensor's performance and lifespan.
5. Maintenance and calibration requirements depend on the sensing elements and frequency of use. 

In summary, the POLYSENSE Externally Connected Sensor offers strong compatibility, robust performance, and adaptability, making it an effective tool for empowering IoT-based solutions. However, it is crucial to understand its limitations to ensure it meets your specific requirements.
