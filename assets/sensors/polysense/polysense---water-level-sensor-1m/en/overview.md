## Technical Overview of POLYSENSE - Water Level Sensor 1M (POLYSENSE)

### Working Principles:

POLYSENSE - Water Level Sensor 1M (POLYSENSE) is an intelligent, precise, and high-quality monitoring device. It makes use of an ultrasonic sensor that emits sound waves at a frequency too high for humans to hear. Upon striking the surface of the water these waves are reflected back to the sensor which measures the time taken for this round-trip. By knowing the speed of sound in air, the system accurately calculates the distance between the sensor and the water surface, thereby determining the water level.

### Installation Guide:

To install the POLYSENSE water level sensor, follow these steps:

1. Choose a suitable location directly above the water source where the sensor can measure water levels effectively without any obstructions.
2. Securely fasten the sensor platform above the water surface ensuring the sensor faces straight down onto the surface. 
3. Connect the sensor to the power source and ensure your LoRaWAN gateway is active.
4. Pair the sensor with your network following manufacturer instructions.
5. Once the sensor is installed and paired with your network, ensure the sensor is operational by running an initial water level detection test.

### LoRaWAN Details:

POLYSENSE Water Level Sensor operates with LoRaWAN protocol connectivity, a wide area network protocol that allows IoT and M2M devices to wirelessly communicate over long distances while consuming minimal power. Its operational Frequency is at 868 MHz (EU), 915 MHz (US) with maximum output power of 16 dBm. It has deep indoor penetration and optimized integrity of data transmission, supporting up to 64 channels simultaneously.

### Power Consumption:

The POLYSENSE Water Level Sensor is highly power efficient and is generally powered by a 3.7V rechargeable lithium battery. Its power consumption varies between 1.3 - 3.7mA in the sleep mode, 14.2mA during data transmission, and 12.3mA during data reception respectively.

### Use Cases:

The POLYSENSE Water Level Sensor can be used in a wide range of applications including but not limited to:

1. Municipal Water Supply Monitoring: Ensure water sources do not overflow or dry up unexpectedly.
2. Agricultural Sector: Monitoring irrigation levels and conditions for optimising water usage.
3. Flood Detection: Real-time monitoring and early prediction of flood situations in susceptible regions.
4. Industrial Liquid Storage: The sensor can also gauge levels of non-aggressive liquids other than water in industrial setting.

### Limitations:

While the POLYSENSE Water Level Sensor is a versatile device, it does have a few limitations:

1. Sensor Range: The sensor can measure only upto 1 meter distance accurately, which may not be suitable for extremely deep water sources.
2. Obstruction: The sensor must have a clear pathway to the water source; any physical obstruction can lead to inaccurate readings.
3. Data Transmission: Though LoRaWAN is known for its long range, environmental factors and certain obstructive materials may impact the signal transmission.
4. Other Liquid Media: The sensor may not accurately measure the levels of aggressive, corrosive, or non-aqueous liquids.
