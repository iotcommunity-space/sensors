OVERVIEW

The POLYSENSE Indoor Intrusion Carpet Sensor is a sophisticated IoT device designed for smart intrusion detection by utilizing the latest developments in IoT and sensor technology. 

WORKING PRINCIPLES

This advanced sensor system operates based on a pressure-sensitive carpet module, employing highly sensitive pressure sensors. When someone steps on the carpet, the sensors under the fabric detect the pressure changes and transmit signals to the controller. The controller analyzes the signal strength, assigns an identification tag, and sends it to a cloud-based application using LoRaWAN protocol. 

INSTALLATION GUIDE 

The installation of POLYSENSE is easy and requires no expert knowledge. First, fasten the sensor module to the carpet backing. Once the sensors are correctly fixed, connect the LoRaWan controller to the sensor module using the connectors provided. Lastly, make sure the system is correctly configured to send alerts via LoRaWAN to the chosen cloud application in case of an intrusion.

LoRaWAN DETAILS 

LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) is a protocol specifically designed for wireless battery-operated IoT applications. Due to its long-range, low power consumption, and high capacity, it is most suitable for POLYSENSE. The controller uses this protocol to send real-time alerts to an assigned end-point if a pressure variation is detected on the carpet.

POWER CONSUMPTION 

The POLYSENSE sensor system uses little energy thanks to the low-power LoRaWAN communications and the efficient design of the pressure sensors. The standby power consumption is minimal, ensuring that the system remains operational for extended periods without the need for frequent battery replacements.

USE CASES 

The POLYSENSE Indoor Intrusion Carpet Sensor is broadly utilized in various spaces for security purposes. These include, but aren't limited to residential homes, office buildings, and in museums for protecting valuable artifacts. Additionally, it can be used in high security areas where unauthorized access is to be prevented.

LIMITATIONS 

While the POLYSENSE sensor system is cutting-edge, some potential limitations exist. Firstly, high foot traffic might lead to false alarms and hence the system might need to be calibrated frequently to differentiate between regular foot traffic and potential intruders. Secondly, it relies heavily on a robust network connection, so any disruptions could affect its performance. Finally, the sensitivity of the pressure sensors implies that even the slightest unintentional pressure could potentially trigger an alarm, leading to false positives. 

In conclusion, while POLYSENSE Indoor Intrusion Carpet Sensor system has its limitations, its advanced features, low power requirement, and practical applications make it an excellent choice for intrusion detection in an array of settings.
