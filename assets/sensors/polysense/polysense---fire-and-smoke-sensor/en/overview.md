## POLYSENSE Fire and Smoke Sensor

### **Technical Overview**
POLYSENSE Fire and Smoke Sensor is an IoT device designed for efficient and sensitive detection of smoke and fire occurrences. The working principle of this sensor revolves around the utilization of optical sensing technology that detects light scatter within the sensor chamber. When smoke enters the chamber, it disrupts the light path, causing some light to hit the sensor. The more dense the smoke becomes, the more light hits the sensor, causing an increase in signal strength.

The POLYSENSE sensor also integrates a thermistor for temperature measurement to boost the detection of fire. The thermistor possesses highly sensitive heat-detecting materials that help perceive increased temperature levels, often an indicator of fire.

### **Installation Guide**
Installation of the POLYSENSE sensor is fairly straightforward and user-friendly. It's designed for a ceiling mount setup, which often provides an ideal vantage point for early smoke detection. The general steps include:

1. Decide where your sensor will be located, preferably in areas prone to smoke or fire such as kitchens or furnace rooms. Ensure that the sensor is not positioned near ventilation sources or windows to avoid false alarms.

2. Attach the mounting bracket on the ceiling using the provided screws.

3. Slot the sensor into the mounting bracket and ensure it's firmly secured.

4. Finally, adjust the settings (if necessary) and test the sensor to ensure that it is functioning correctly.

### **LoRaWAN Details**
The POLYSENSE Fire and Smoke Sensor possesses LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) capabilities. This technology allows for long range communication with low power consumption. The device operates in the EU868 or the US915 frequency band to comply with LoRaWAN regional parameters. Also, it provides bidirectional communication, end-to-end security, and has a high capacity to support millions of messages daily.

### **Power Consumption**
The POLYSENSE sensor operates on a low power consumption mode to optimize battery life, which can last up to 5 years, depending on operation parameters, signal strength, and environmental conditions. Its average power consumption is 0.14mW.

### **Use Cases**
Typically, the POLYSENSE Fire and Smoke Sensor is used in environments where there's a high risk of fire and smoke incidents. These include:

1. Residential Homes: For early detection of smoke and fire.
2. Commercial Premises: To safeguard property and vital documents.
3. Industrial Sites: To prevent large scale damage of expensive machinery.
4. Forests: For early detection of wildfires to aid in rapid response.

### **Limitations**
1. False Alarms: Like other smoke detectors, POLYSENSE may produce false alarms, especially if positioned near ventilation sources or windows.
2. Interference: The device might have limited operation in environments with interfering signals or where the chunk of signals are already taken up.
3. Maintenance: The sensor needs regular maintenance and testing to ensure proper operation.
4. Battery: As it runs on battery power, the battery will need to be replaced after its lifespan is depleted.
