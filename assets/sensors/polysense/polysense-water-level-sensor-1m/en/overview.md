# POLYSENSE - Water Level Sensor 1M Technical Overview

## Introduction

The POLYSENSE Water Level Sensor 1M is an advanced IoT device designed to measure and report water levels with high accuracy. Specifically engineered for LoRaWAN network integration, this sensor offers low power consumption and ease of deployment across a variety of applications. It is suitable for monitoring water levels in tanks, reservoirs, streams, and other water bodies.

## Working Principles

The POLYSENSE Water Level Sensor employs hydrostatic pressure technology to determine water depth. The sensor consists of a pressure transducer that translates changes in water pressure into an electrical signal. This signal is then processed to quantify the water level, taking into account variables such as specific gravity and temperature. The sensor's onboard electronics calibrate the pressure readings and generate data outputs that can be transmitted over long distances via LoRaWAN communication.

## Installation Guide

### Components Required
- POLYSENSE Water Level Sensor
- LoRaWAN gateway
- Mounting kit
- Cable ties or fasteners

### Installation Steps
1. **Site Assessment**: Identify an appropriate location for sensor deployment where water level measurements are required. Consider ease of access and ensure the location has an operational LoRaWAN signal.
   
2. **Mounting**: Securely mount the sensor using the provided mounting kit. It's essential for the sensor to be vertically submersed in the water body without air bubbles trapped directly under it, which might interfere with readings.
   
3. **Connection**: Use cable ties or fasteners to organize and secure wires and connection leads along the mounting structure, preventing damage or disconnection without hindering data transmission.
   
4. **Commissioning**: Power up the sensor and configure it via any provided software or mobile app. Ensure it establishes communication with a nearby LoRaWAN gateway.
   
5. **Calibration**: Calibrate the sensor as instructed in the manufacturerâ€™s manual. Verify its accuracy by comparing its readings against a known measurement.

## LoRaWAN Details

- **Frequency Bands**: Compatible with all common LoRaWAN frequency bands, such as EU868, US915, AU915, AS923, etc.
- **Data Rate**: It supports adaptive data rate enhance coverage and minimizes power consumption.
- **Coverage**: Typically offers a line-of-sight range of up to 15 km (10 miles) with effective range reduced by urban obstacles.
- **Security**: Data encryption using AES 128-bit encryption, complying with LoRaWAN security standards.
- **Network Integration**: Simple integration with existing LoRaWAN networks, using appropriate network server configurations to manage and visualize sensor data.

## Power Consumption

The POLYSENSE Water Level Sensor is designed for energy efficiency, ideal for remote installations where frequent maintenance is impractical. It is powered using a long-lasting lithium battery, with a lifespan of up to 5 years depending on reporting intervals. The sensor utilizes sleep modes to conserve energy, waking only to take and transmit measurements at user-defined intervals.

## Use Cases

- **Water Tank Management**: Optimize the filling and usage cycles of water tanks.
- **Flood Detection**: Monitor rising water levels in flood-prone areas.
- **Agriculture**: Manage irrigation by accurately assessing water levels in storage and watering systems.
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Track groundwater levels or changes in natural water bodies for conservation efforts.
- **Municipal Water Systems**: Observe reservoir and drainage levels to support municipal water infrastructure management.

## Limitations

- **Installation Environment**: Requires careful installation to ensure no air bubbles or debris interfere with readings. Regular maintenance may be needed in debris-filled environments.
- **RF Interference**: Urban environments might exhibit reduced range due to radio frequency interference from buildings and other structures.
- **Calibration Needs**: Periodic calibration is recommended to maintain accuracy over time, especially in environments with varying conditions such as salinity or temperature gradients.
- **Battery Life**: Although designed for longevity, frequent reporting can reduce battery life, necessitating strategic data scheduling based on application requirements.
- **Temperature Limits**: Extreme temperatures may impact sensor performance and measurement reliability, requiring suitable installation considerations or protection.

In conclusion, the POLYSENSE Water Level Sensor 1M is an effective tool for a diverse range of applications, providing reliable data through low-power, low-maintenance operation optimized for LoRaWAN networks. With proper installation and periodic calibration, it can vastly improve water management efforts across various sectors.
