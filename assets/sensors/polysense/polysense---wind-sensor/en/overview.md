# POLYSENSE Wind Sensor: Technical Overview

## Working Principles
The POLYSENSE Wind Sensor operates using the principles of anemometry, which measures wind speed and direction. This is achieved using a rotor with three cups designed to capture the wind. As air moves through the rotor, the cups generate a potential difference proportional to the wind's speed. This difference is captured and converted into an electrical signal that saturates at higher wind speeds for safety reasons.

The sensor uses a wind vane to measure wind direction. The vane aligns itself with the wind, and its position is determined using a potentiometer. The resulting resistance is converted into an electrical signal that corresponds precisely to the wind direction.

## Installation Guide
The POLYSENSE Wind Sensor is relatively straightforward to install. First, install the sensors on a pole, ensuring the sensors consistently face the predominant wind direction. Connect the wind speed and direction sensors to their respective ports on the main unit. Once installed accurately, power up the system. Following this, test the functioning of the sensor by simulating wind conditions before committing it to full usage.

## LoRaWAN Details
The POLYSENSE Wind Sensor leverages the Low Power Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN), affording it excellent coverage and low power consumption. The sensor supports the LoRaWAN 1.0.2 protocol, operating in multiple frequency bands, notably 868MHz (EU), 915MHz (US), and 470MHz (China). Different versions can be programmed to operate in different regions, and their SF (spreading factor) can be configured to optimize between range and power consumption.

## Power Consumption
The POLYSENSE Wind Sensor is designed for low power consumption, key for remote and often hard-to-reach settings. It features an ultra-low power design, allowing it to be powered for extended periods off a small battery. Specific treatments can reduce the power consumption during idle periods further.

## Use Cases
POLYSENSE Wind Sensor is versatile, used in a variety of applications. It is often employed for weather monitoring, on-site weather forecasting, and to assist in farming operations. It is also used in the construction industry, environmental studies, emergency disaster management, wind power project planning, and for UAVs and drones to estimate wind speeds and direction.

## Limitations
While the POLYSENSE Wind Sensor is a highly capable device, it has its limitations. It suffers from a lack of accuracy in very turbulent conditions due to high fluctuations in wind speed and direction. The sensor's power consumption, while incredibly low, is not zero, making it inadequate for applications where there is no power source available for extended periods. Lastly, the parts are not entirely immune to weathering and may wear out over time, especially with exposure to harsh environmental conditions. 

Maintenance and occasional replacement of the batteries, the rotor cups, and the vane are required to keep the sensor operating efficiently throughout its lifespan.
