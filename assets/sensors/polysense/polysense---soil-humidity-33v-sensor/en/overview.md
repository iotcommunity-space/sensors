# POLYSENSE - Soil Humidity 33V Sensor Technical Documentation

## Overview

The POLYSENSE - Soil Humidity 33V Sensor is an ideal IoT product that delivers efficacious soil moisture readings in real-time. The sensor operates on state-of-the-art technology to facilitate accurate and effective soil humidity measurements. This document provides a comprehensive technical guide about its working principles, installation process, LoRaWAN specifics, power consumption, use cases, and limitations.

## Working Principle

The POLYSENSE soil humidity sensor uses capacitance to measure the water content in the soil. The sensor creates an electromagnetic field around its surface. When placed in soil, it measures the change in capacitance caused by the dielectric permittivity of the soil (which changes with the soil's water content) to calculate the soil humidity. The data is then transmitted to the assigned LoRaWAN device.

## Installation Guide

Installation guidelines for the sensor are as follows:

1. Location: Choose a location where the sensor will be partially buried in the soil. Make sure the location is representative of the overall field.
2. Installation: Using a soil auger or corer, create a hole of suitable size. In a vertical orientation, insert the sensor so approximately two-thirds is buried in the soil. Be cautious not to damage it.
3. Connection: Connect the sensor to your device following the manufacturer's instructions included with the product.
4. Test: Once installed, conduct a test to make sure the soil humidity data is properly getting logged on your device. 

## LoRaWAN Details

The POLYSENSE - Soil Humidity 33V Sensor uses Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) technology through the LoRa protocol. It enables the transmission of data over long distances using minimal power. LoRaWAN features a flexible network architecture which can be either public or private. The specifics of the LoRaWAN details such as activation, protocol version, data rate, channels, and device EUI will be provided individually for each device by the manufacturer or service provider.

## Power Consumption

The POLYSENSE sensor is engineered for minimum power consumption. It operates on low power mode by default, waking up only to take measurements or transmit data. This power-efficient design makes the sensor ideal for remote or inaccessible locations, where frequent battery replacement may not be practical.

## Use Cases

1. Agriculture: The sensor is widely used in agricultural fields for precise irrigation, controlling water usage, and optimizing harvest.
2. Greenhouses: It helps maintain optimal conditions for plant growth.
3. Research: Universities and research organizations can use the sensor to study soil conditions.
4. Landscaping: Helps ensure healthy grass and vegetation by monitoring soil conditions.

## Limitations

While the POLYSENSE sensor offers multiple benefits, it has few limitations:

1. Sensitivity: The sensor is sensitive to salts in the soil which may affect accuracy.
2. Ambient Interference: Electromagnetic signals can disrupt the sensor’s readings.
3. Burial Depth: The sensor only measures soil moisture at the depth at which it’s buried, making it less effective for deep root crops.

In conclusion, the POLYSENSE - Soil Humidity 33V Sensor, with its advanced features and real-time data monitoring, can play a profound role in optimizing water usage while also providing substantial insight into soil health.
