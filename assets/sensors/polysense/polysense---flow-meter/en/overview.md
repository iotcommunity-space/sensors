## TECHNICAL OVERVIEW: POLYSENSE - FLOW METER (POLYSENSE)

### 1. Working Principles

The POLYSENSE - Flow Meter is an IoT sensor designed to quantify the rate of fluid movement through a pipe. It uses the principle of fluid dynamics to determine the flow velocity which is then utilized to calculate the volumetric flow rate.

The device employs an ultrasonic flow meter that emits ultrasonic waves across the fluid path in the pipe. These waves travel faster in the direction of the fluid flow and slower against it. The flow meter measures the time difference and uses this data to determine the fluid's flow speed and subsequently its flow rate.

### 2. Installation Guide

The POLYSENSE - Flow Meter can be installed either inline with the fluid path (intrusive method) or clamped to the external wall of the pipe (non-intrusive or clamp-on method). 

For the intrusive method, installation requires cutting a section of the pipe and inserting the flow meter section with requisite coupling. For the non-intrusive method, a clamp-on device is attached to the external side of the pipe.

In both cases, the sensor should be connected to the data acquisition system and appropriately synchronized. 

### 3. LoRaWAN Details 

LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) is a protocol designed for wireless battery-operated devices in a regional, national or global network. The POLYSENSE - Flow Meter supports LoRaWAN technology, enabling it to transmit data over long distances without using significant power.

The sensor is also compatible with all global LoRaWAN frequencies (US902-928, Europe868, etc.) and supports adaptive data rate (ADR), allowing it to adjust transmission rates based on network conditions.

### 4. Power Consumption 

The POLYSENSE - Flow Meter operates on minimal power allowing it to function for extended periods without the need for frequent battery changes. It features an internal battery that can last up to 10 years depending on the frequency of data transmission and environmental conditions. 

### 5. Use Cases 

The POLYSENSE - Flow Meter is adaptable across numerous industries for an array of applications. In agriculture and irrigation systems, it monitors and controls water flow to ensure optimal water utilization. In oil and gas industries, it accurately measures the flow of petroleum products. In water treatment plants, it is applied in leak detection and regulation of wastewater flow. 

### 6. Limitations 

The POLYSENSE - Flow Meter, while having many benefits, also has some limitations. The accuracy of measurements may be influenced by elements like particulate matter in the fluid or turbulent flow. Heavy metallic pipe walls could also hinder the effectiveness of non-intrusive installations. Furthermore, the device's performance could be limited in environments with high electromagnetic interference.
