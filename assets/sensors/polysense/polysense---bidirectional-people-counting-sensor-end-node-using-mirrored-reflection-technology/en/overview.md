## POLYSENSE â€“ Bidirectional People Counting Sensor Documentation

### 1. Overview
The POLYSENSE Bidirectional People Counting Sensor End Node constitutes an IoT device that employs Mirrored Reflection Technology for the purpose of tracking and counting the number of individuals passing through a specified location. This comprehensive guide is designed to elucidate the installation procedure, limitations, and functional aspects of this versatile device. 

### 2. Working Principle
The primary operational principle underlying this sensor is Mirrored Reflection Technology. This sensor discerns variations in infrared waves reflected from individual bodies and hence successfully counts a single individual at a time, even in a crowd. The sensor module is designed to differentiate bidirectional pedestrian movement using two reflective modules, which enables to identify whether the object is entering or exiting the specified area.

### 3. Installation Guide
The installation of the POLYSENSE sensor should be carried out under the guidance of an experienced technician for a flawless performance. Ensure that the sensor is placed approximately 1.5 to 2.5 meters above the ground. The sensor must be installed horizontally across the area to be monitored with a clear line of sight for optimal performance. Keep the sensor at an appropriate distance to cover the entire area without any disturbances.

### 4. LoRaWAN Details
The POLYSENSE Bidirectional People Counting Sensor integrates with Low Power Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) Class A technology. This guarantees low power consumption while ensuring long-range wireless transmission of data. The sensor utilizes LoRaWAN protocol for transmitting data, which guarantees secure and reliable communication.

### 5. Power Consumption
The exact power consumption of this sensor depends upon the frequency of use. However, being based on LoRaWAN technology, it means the power consumption is relatively low. It has a power-conserving mode, allowing the device to operate for a prolonged time on battery power.

### 6. Use Cases
The POLYSENSE Bidirectional People Counting Sensor is employed in several scenarios. Retail establishments may use it to monitor the influx of customers, transportation hubs could track passenger footfall, and security personnel could use it to keep tabs on personnel traffic in certain regions. Further, it can be used in event management for crowd counting.

### 7. Limitations
While POLYSENSE boasts of high performance, it's worth noting some limitations. Its performance may be compromised if the device isn't installed correctly. The sensor might not perfectly count if individuals are exceptionally close together or passing simultaneously. Its performance may also be affected in environments with very high or low-temperature ranges.

In conclusion, the POLYSENSE Bidirectional People Counting Sensor End Node guarantees reliable tracking and counting of individuals. For optimal performance, ensure correct installation and proper maintenance.
