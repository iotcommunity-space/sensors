# Technical Overview for POLYSENSE Wind Speed Sensor

## Introduction

The POLYSENSE Wind Speed Sensor is a state-of-the-art device designed for accurate and reliable measurement of wind speed, suitable for various applications across industries. The sensor integrates seamlessly with IoT ecosystems using LoRaWAN connectivity, making it ideal for remote monitoring applications. 

## Working Principles

The POLYSENSE Wind Speed Sensor employs a three-cup anemometer design, a proven mechanical solution for capturing wind speed efficiently. As the cups rotate due to wind forces, they drive a shaft connected to either a magnetic or optical encoder. This encoder converts the rotational speed into an electronic signal proportional to the wind speed. The onboard microcontroller processes this signal, converting it into digital form for further transmission.

Key features:
- **High Sensitivity**: Designed to detect low wind speeds starting from 0.3 m/s.
- **Range**: Capable of measuring wind speeds up to 50 m/s with precision.
- **Durability**: Constructed with UV-resistant materials designed to withstand harsh environmental conditions.

## Installation Guide

### Components Included:
- Wind Speed Sensor Unit
- Mounting Arm
- Shielded Cable (for power and data transmission)
- User Manual

### Installation Steps:
1. **Location Selection**: Choose an open area that is unobstructed, ideally 10 times the height of the nearest obstruction. Ensure that the sensor is at least 3 meters above ground.
  
2. **Mounting the Sensor**: Use the provided mounting arm to fix the sensor securely on a stable pole or structure. Ensure the sensor is level and firmly secured to prevent vibrations affecting measurements.

3. **Electrical Connections**: Connect the shielded cable to the power source and, if necessary, to data logging equipment. Ensure all connectors are weatherproofed.

4. **Calibration**: The sensor is factory-calibrated but verification against a known standard is recommended upon installation.

5. **Commissioning**: Power on the sensor and verify operation through real-time data observation. Check for proper data transmission via LoRaWAN.

## LoRaWAN Details

The POLYSENSE sensor utilizes LoRaWAN for wireless data transmission. It supports the following:

- **Frequency Bands**: Compatible with various regional ISM bands, including EU868 and US915.
- **Data Rate**: Adaptive data rate (ADR) compliant to optimize both battery life and network capacity.
- **Network Integration**: Easily integrates into existing LoRaWAN networks. Requires activation via Over-the-Air Activation (OTAA) or Activation by Personalization (ABP).
- **Data Packet Specifications**: Regular reporting interval configurable from 5 minutes to 1 hour depending on requirements.

## Power Consumption

The sensor is designed for low power consumption, critical for extended remote deployments:

- **Average Power Consumption**: Less than 10 mA in active measurement mode.
- **Sleep Mode**: Consumes less than 100 ÂµA.
- **Power Supply Options**: Operates on a wide range of DC power levels from 5V to 24V or via solar power solutions equipped with a rechargeable battery system.

## Use Cases

- **Weather Stations**: Provides meteorologists with accurate wind data for better weather predictions.
- **Agriculture**: Helps farmers assess wind conditions for pesticide and nutrient spraying.
- **Renewable Energy**: Valuable in wind farm locations to evaluate site suitability and turbine performance.
- **Smart Cities**: Integrates into urban monitoring systems to inform about urban wind patterns impacting pollution dispersion.

## Limitations

- **Sensitivity to Vibration**: Installation must minimize vibration as this can affect accuracy.
- **Maintenance**: Periodic maintenance is needed to ensure the bearings in the anemometer cups remain unobstructed by debris or corrosion.
- **Signal Interference**: Though limited, LoRaWAN communications can experience interference in dense urban environments.
- **Temperature Extremes**: Performance can be impacted by extreme low temperatures leading to potential inaccuracies or mechanical failure in icy conditions.

## Conclusion

The POLYSENSE Wind Speed Sensor is an innovative solution catering to diverse needs in environmental monitoring, offering reliable, accurate wind speed measurements combined with efficient IoT connectivity. Its robust, energy-efficient design ensures it is well-suited for a wide range of outdoor applications, although care must be taken to address its operational limitations.
