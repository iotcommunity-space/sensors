**POLYSENSE MICROWAVE RADAR SENSOR (POLYSENSE) TECHNICAL OVERVIEW**

**1. Working Principles**
The POLYSENSE microwave radar sensor operates by transmitting radio waves and analyzing the reflection or echo from an object. This allows for the detection of movement, speeds, and distances even in the absence of light or under harsh weather conditions. The sensor works through the Doppler Effect, where the frequency of the returned signal changes depending on the speed of the target object moving towards or away from the sensor.

**2. Installation Guide**
Installation of the POLYSENSE sensor requires careful selection of a location to ensure accurate sensing. The preferred installation height is 2-8 meters above the ground. Ensure the sensor is mounted on a stable object surface and oriented towards the area needing monitoring. Use braces or brackets to mount the sensor. Connect the sensor signal output to your device interface, ensuring the right polarity.

**3. LoRaWAN Details**
The POLYSENSE microwave radar sensor is equipped with Long-Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) technology. LoRaWAN is a Low Power Wide Area Network protocol which offers low power consumption with high range communication capabilities. The sensor complies with the latest LoRaWAN specifications, providing secure and efficient data transmission, to enable IoT applications. It operates in the standard industrial, scientific, and medical ISM band.

**4. Power Consumption**
The POLYSENSE microwave radar sensor is optimized for low power consumption. It takes a supply voltage of 3.3V to 5.5V and has a static current of less than 2mA in measurement, thereby saving on power, enabling it to run continuously for years. It transitions to an idle or sleep mode after periods of inactivity to further conserve power.

**5. Use Cases**
Several use cases are possible due to the reliable and accurate detection capability of this sensor. Use cases include traffic and vehicle detection, industrial automation in warehouses, smart home security systems, people counting in retail and commercial arenas, and drone navigation and collision-avoidance systems.

**6. Limitations**
Despite numerous advantages, there are certain restrictions with the POLYSENSE microwave radar sensor. Radar sensors can produce false alarms from unintended objects like trees, birds, or insects. They require a straight line-of-sight and large objects or walls can obscure the sensor's view. Additionally, initial setup and calibration of radar sensors can be relatively complex, given factors like sensitivity, angle, and installation height need to be considered. The performance of the sensor can also be impaired by EM interference from other devices operating on the same ISM band. 

In conclusion, the POLYSENSE microwave radar sensor provides enhanced motion detection capabilities for a wide range of applications, but attention must be given to its optimum installation, sensitivity settings, and surrounding environment to ensure its effective functioning.
