### Technical Overview: POLYSENSE Bidirectional People Counting Sensor End Node Using Diffuse Reflection Technology

**Working Principles**

The POLYSENSE Bidirectional People Counting Sensor End Node utilizes cutting-edge Diffuse Reflection Technology to monitor activities in a controlled space. The system employs an infrared emitter and receiver, which work together to monitor the number and movement of people.

When an individual passes through the monitored area, the emitted rays bounce off the person and get reflected back to the receiver. The system detects changes in the strength of the reflected rays, thus recording the number of people entering or leaving the space.

**Installation Guide**

Installation of the POLYSENSE Bidirectional People Counting Sensor should be performed carefully to ensure optimal performance. The sensor should be hung vertically in the area where movement needs to be tracked. The device should be mounted at a height depending on ceiling height and the height of expected objects moving beneath.

Ensure the sensor is secured firmly and the included templates and markings to ensure correct alignment are utilised. After installation, use the provided software to calibrate the sensor according to the specific environment and intended usage.

**LoRaWAN Details**

The POLYSENSE Bidirectional People Counting Sensor utilizes LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) technology for robust, secure, and scalable communication. The device operates in the unlicensed radio spectrum, preventing operational interference issues. The sensor supports multiple LoRaWAN classes (A, C), various data rates, and has adaptive data rate capabilities. This robust networking allows the sensor to communicate effectively and efficiently with minimal power consumption, and over large distances, indoors or outdoors.

**Power Consumption**

The POLYSENSE sensor has low power consumption, making it ideal for continuous use. It uses power-efficient components and intelligent power management algorithms to reduce power usage. In standby mode, the power consumption is negligible. During active use, power consumption varies depending on usage levels, LoRaWAN parameters, and environmental conditions.

**Use Cases**

POLYSENSE sensors are useful in various environments:

1. Retail: Retailers can monitor shopper entry and exit, and use the data to optimize store operations, like staff allocation, and marketing strategies.

2. Facilities Management: Measure occupancy to ensure compliance with health regulations, and monitor use of space for optimization.

3. Transportation: In bus or train stations, they can provide data on crowd density, helping with crowd management and safety measures.

**Limitations**

While the POLYSENSE sensor is highly accurate and efficient, certain factors can affect its performance:

- Physical obstructions: Metallic objects or dense structures between the transmitter and receiver can impact the sensor's ability to record accurately,
  
- High traffic areas: In extremely crowded areas, the sensor might miss some people if several pass through its range simultaneously,
  
- Low-light conditions: The sensor relies on infrared technology, and while it can function in a variety of lighting conditions, its performance might be affected in very low light.

Despite these limitations, POLYSENSE Bidirectional People Counting Sensor offers an effective solution for people counting and movement tracking applications.
