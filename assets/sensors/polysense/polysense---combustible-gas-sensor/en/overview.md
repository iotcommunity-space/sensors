## POLYSENSE Combustible Gas Sensor - Technical Overview 

POLYSENSE Combustible Gas Sensor is a top-of-the-line IoT device essential for sensing different types of combustible gases present in the environment. This device utilizes advanced sensing technology providing real-time accurate data, ensuring rigorous safety standards while avoiding potential hazards.

### Working Principles

POLYSENSE Combustible Gas Sensor operates utilizing the working principle of electrochemical gas detection. During this process, when the combustible gas comes into contact with the gas sensor's surface, an electrochemical reaction occurs, causing a flow of electrons. Sensors interpret these electron flows as a signal, which is then processed and compared against pre-set values that characterize gas concentrations.

### Installation Guide

1. **Location:** Position the sensor near areas where combustible gases may accumulate. 
2. **Mounting:** Attach the sensor to the field surface. Secure it firmly using screws or mounting brackets. 
3. **Configuration:** Connect the sensor to your LoRaWAN network. This process may involve scanning a QR code or entering an ID manually, depending on your specific network setup. 
4. **Testing:** Once installed, perform several test runs to certify the sensor's functionality.

### LoRaWAN Details

The sensor communicates via the LoRaWAN (Low Range Wide Area Network) which provides long-range connectivity that does not require a substantial amount of power. LoRAWANâ€™s adaptive data rate algorithm maximizes the sensor's battery life and network capacity, while its geolocation feature allows it to track and monitor exact locations.

### Power Consumption

With a battery life spanning from 5 to 10 years depending, the POLYSENSE sensor exhibits impressive low power consumption. The power usage may vary depending on the frequency of transmission of data and the type of combustible gas it monitors and detects.

### Use Cases

- **Industrial monitoring:** It can be deployed in industrial sites to prevent hazards related to combustible gases.
- **Environment Monitoring:** Public agencies can use it to monitor and enforce compliance with environmental regulations.
- **Home Safety:** It can be installed in homes to alert the inhabitants of potential gas leaks, thereby preventing fatal accidents.
- **Mining operations:** In mining applications, it can be used to ensure workers' safety by providing early warnings of gas leakages.

### Limitations

Despite its comprehensive benefits, some limitations to consider include:

1. **Environmental Conditions:** While it is generally robust, its performance and longevity may be affected by extreme environmental conditions.
2. **Data Limit:** As with most LoRaWAN devices, it has a limitation on the amount of data it can send to avoid network congestion.
3. **Non-Combustible Gases:** It cannot detect and monitor non-combustible gases.
4. **Interference:** High levels of humidity, dust, or other gases may interfere with the sensor's performance.
5. **Maintenance:** The sensor's components may degrade over time, requiring regular maintenance.

In conclusion, the POLYSENSE Combustible Gas Sensor provides an efficient way to ensure safety and compliance in many applications. Robust in its operation and long-lasting in its build, it brings invaluable peace of mind to all of its users.
