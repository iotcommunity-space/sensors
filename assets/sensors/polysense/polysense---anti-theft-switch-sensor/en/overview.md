## POLYSENSE Anti Theft Switch Sensor (POLYSENSE) - Technical Overview

### Working Principles

The POLYSENSE Anti Theft Switch Sensor is a state-of-the-art, battery-driven wireless sensor designed to detect when a particular device or item is moved or displaced. This innovative piece of technology operates through an onboard accelerometer which is triggered whenever motion is detected.

When the sensor's orientation is altered or movement data exceeds the configured threshold, the device alerts the user and sends out notifications over the LoRaWAN network. This technology features machine-learning algorithms to distinguish different movement patterns and eliminate false alarms, enhancing its reliability for anti-theft purposes.

### Installation Guide

Installing the POLYSENSE Anti Theft Switch Sensor is relatively straightforward and can be completed without the need for a professional technician:

1. Choose an ideal location for the device - This should be a spot on the equipment or availability where movement or displacement will be easily detected.

2. Fix the sensor onto your chosen location - The POLYSENSE can be affixed to the site with its inbuilt adhesive back, or by using screws into the mounting holes.

3. Power-up the device - Switch the sensor ON, and it will automatically start transmitting data periodically to a paired gateway in its coverage area.

4. Set the configuration - Connect the sensor to your network through your chosen LoRaWAN gateway. Adjust any necessary settings, such as the sensitivity of the sensor or the frequency of data transmission, according to your specific requirements.

### LoRaWAN Details

The POLYSENSE Anti Theft Switch Sensor uses a LoRaWAN protocol to transmit data over long distances, while ensuring low power consumption, and offering broad security features. Compatible with global LoRaWAN frequencies (including EU868, US915, AS923, CN470, and AU915), the POLYSENSE sensor can adapt to different regions with an appropriate LoRaWAN gateway.

### Power Consumption

Boasting state-of-the-art power management, the sensor operates on a 4.5V battery power supply. In standard operating conditions, this battery life can exceed three years. However, factors that may affect this include transmission frequency, surrounding environment, and the complexity of the tracked movements. The sensor also features low battery alert capabilities.

### Use Cases

The POLYSENSE Anti Theft Switch Sensor can be used in a multitude of applications including:

1. Asset Protection - Monitors valuable assets such as machinery, artwork, or high-value retail products.
2. Vehicle Security - Protects cars, bikes, boats, and other vehicles from theft, by alerting owners to unauthorised movement.
3. Logistic Solutions - Reports if shipping containers, warehouse items, or transported goods are tempered or displaced.

### Limitations

Though the POLYSENSE Sensor is highly versatile and user-friendly, it does have limitations:

1. Signal Range - The effective range of the sensor may suffer due to obstacles or harsh conditions, which could affect the LoRaWAN signal.
2. Battery Life - Factors like extreme temperature or signal range can reduce the sensorâ€™s battery life.
3. False Alerts - While the sensor is capable of distinguishing different motion patterns, it is not infallible. There may be instances where unexpected motion or tampering might get unnoticed or generate false alerts.
