## Technical Overview: POLYSENSE - Magnetic Switch Sensor

### Working Principles

The POLYSENSE Magnetic Switch Sensor is a device that utilizes the principle of magnetic field detection to identify changes within an environment. Upon the entrance or exit of a magnetic field within its operational range, the switch is triggered and the sensor generates a signal that is then transmitted to a centralized device or a network.

The sensor uses a dual magnet system where if a synchronized magnetic field enters the detection range of the sensor, the device will activate the switch, and if it exits, the sensor will deactivate the switch. This actionable data is then transformed via an ADC (Analog to Digital Converter) and transmitted to the destination.

### Installation Guide

The POLYSENSE Magnetic Switch Sensor is designed for simple and efficient installation. The step by step installation process is as follows:

1. Identify an optimal placement location for the sensor that is within range of the magnetic field.
2. Attach the sensor securely to the surface with the included attachment accessories (which may include adhesive, screw-mountings or magnetic attachments as per model).
3. Connect it to the LoRaWAN network by configuring the sensor settings with your network gateway identification information.
4. Adjust the sensitivity and other operational parameters as per project requirements. 

### LoRaWAN Details

LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) is a protocol designed for wireless battery-operated devices. POLYSENSE Magnetic Switch Sensor uses this protocol, making it able to communicate over long distances with low power consumption. The LoRaWAN class of the sensor is Class A, which is the most energy-efficient. It supports LoRaWAN version 1.0.2 and operates in multiple frequencies depending on the region (like EU868, US915, etc.).

### Power Consumption

Regarding power consumption, the POLYSENSE Magnetic Switch Sensor is extremely efficient. It operates on battery power, designed for long-term use. Thanks to the energy efficiency of the LoRaWAN protocol, the exact battery life depends on the specific use case and frequency of use but can last for years under normal operation.

### Use Cases

The POLYSENSE Magnetic Switch Sensor is ideal for various applications that require detection of magnetic field changes. Critical use-case sectors include:

1. Security: To detect unauthorized access by placing the sensors at doors or windows.
2. Industrial: To monitor equipment, doors, or moving parts for operational performance or safety.
3. Smart Home: Automate lighting, HVAC or home appliances based on door/window status.

### Limitations

While the POLYSENSE Magnetic Switch Sensor is highly versatile and reliable, there are some limitations:

1. The sensor must be within a specific distance to detect the magnetic field. Its effectiveness decreases with an increase in distance.
2. Its performance may be impaired in environments with high electromagnetic interference.
3. The sensor requires line-of-sight connectivity to a LoRaWAN gateway for effective operation, and physical obstructions between the sensor and the gateway can lead to inconsistent data transmission.
