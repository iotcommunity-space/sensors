## Technical Overview of POLYSENSE - Distance Sensor

### Working Principles

The POLYSENSE Distance Sensor is an advanced Internet of Things (IoT) sensor designed to measure precise distances or depths. Its core is a state-of-the-art ultrasonic sensor that produces an ultrasonic wave which reflects off an object and then returns to the sensor. The sensor then records the time taken for the wave to return, which is used to calculate the actual distance or depth based on the speed of sound. 

### Installation Guide
Installation of POLYSENSE Distance Sensor is straightforward. You simply need to mount the sensor in the desired position where it has a clear linear path to the object whose distance you want to measure. An important point to remember is that the sensor should be installed in environments with minimal obstructions to prevent disruptions in signals which could lead to inaccurate readings.

### LoRaWAN Details
POLYSENSE Distance Sensor uses Low Power Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN), which is a protocol for low-power devices in wide-area networks. This allows devices to communicate with IoT applications over long-range wireless connections. LoRaWAN details for our sensor are as follows:

    Frequency: 868 MHZ/ 915 MHZ/ 923 MHZ
    DevEUI: Will be provided with the device.
    AppEUI: Will be provided with the device.
    AppKey: Will be provided with the device.

### Power Consumption
The POLYSENSE Distance Sensor has been engineered for very low power consumption. In standby mode, it only uses 10uA. Depending on the frequency of readings, a single battery can last anywhere between 5 to 10 years, making it very cost-effective for long-term operations.

### Use Cases
This versatile sensor has a myriad of uses including but not limited to:
 
1. Infrastructure Monitoring: The sensor can be used to monitor the integrity of structures, measuring movements and displacements to identify risks of structural failures.
   
2. Level Monitoring in Tanks: The sensor can measure the level of liquid or any other substance in a tank, providing real-time data which can help prevent overflows or shortages.

3. Vehicle detection: The sensor can be used in parking lots to detect the presence or absence of vehicles.

### Limitations
Despite its uses, the POLYSENSE Distance Sensor does have a few limitations:

1. Environmental Limitations: The sensor relies on the speed of sound, which can vary depending on environmental factors such as temperature and humidity. Therefore, large temperature or humidity swings can affect accuracy.

2. Obstructions: The sensor may not work accurately in spaces with many obstructions or where multi-path interference (waves reflecting off multiple surfaces before getting back to the sensor) is possible.

3. Surface Material: The sensor might give less accurate readings for soft or sound-absorbent materials as they absorb some of the sound waves instead of reflecting them.  

By understanding these limitations, users can maximize the benefits of using this powerful IoT sensor.
