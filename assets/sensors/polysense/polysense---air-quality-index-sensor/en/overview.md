POLYSENSE - Air Quality Index Sensor

Technical Overview

1. Working Principles
The POLYSENSE Air Quality Index Sensor (hereafter referred to as "POLYSENSE") works on the principle of sampling ambient air and measuring the concentration of various pollutants like CO2, PM2.5, PM10, VOCs, NO2 etc. The sensor uses advanced electrochemical sensors, laser scattering principles, and sensitive semiconducting material to determine the concentration of these pollutants. It incorporates a processing unit to convert these raw measurements into an Air Quality Index (AQI) value, adhering to either EPA or custom-defined standards.

The POLYSENSE also includes temperature and humidity sensors to provide essential data for thorough air analysis. The processed data is communicated wirelessly using LoRaWAN technology.

2. Installation Guide
Installing the POLYSENSE requires careful planning to ensure accurate readings. Avoid sources of pollution like cooking areas, exhaust vents, or busy roads. High, unobstructed locations are preferred. The sensor can be mounted on a wall, pole, or a flat surface using its mounting brackets. After mounting, connect the sensor to the LoRaWAN network by pressing the 'pair' button till the LED blinks. Follow network-provider specifics to complete the installation.

3. LoRaWAN Details
The POLYSENSE utilizes LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) technology for robust, long-distance wireless communication. Compatible with LoRaWAN Class A protocol, it can connect to any giving LoRaWAN gateway and supports multiple frequency bands (check model-specifics for frequency bands). It benefits from features like adaptive data rate and advanced security protocols.

4. Power Consumption
The POLYSENSE is a low-power device designed for longevity. It can be powered via battery or an external power source, depending on the model. The exact consumption will vary depending on usage, but typically, it will run on battery for over a year before needing replacement/recharging.

5. Use Cases
POLYSENSE is versatile and caters to various sectors — from environmental monitoring by government institutions to personal use. It's used in Smart City Infrastructure for monitoring air quality in various zones, in industries to ensure workplace safety, in schools and hospitals to maintain healthy indoor air quality, and in home automation systems.

6. Limitations
The POLYSENSE sensor is designed to operate between -20 to +70°C. Measurements might be inaccurate outside this range. Although the sensor's casing is weather-resistant, placing it in extremely harsh weather conditions can deteriorate its performance. While it has a long communication range, obstacles like buildings or metallic structures can affect the signal. Regular calibration is required to maintain accuracy in measurements.

In conclusion, the POLYSENSE provides an affordable and effective solution for diverse AQI monitoring needs. Its low power consumption, coupled with the convenience of LoRaWAN communication, makes it an excellent choice for a wide range of applications.
