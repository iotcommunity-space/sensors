**POLYSENSE - Nh3 Sensor Documentation**

**Overview:**

POLYSENSE Nh3 Sensors are designed to detect and measure the concentration of ammonia (NH3) in the environment. This robust unit is ideally suited for monitoring air quality, industrial safety, and greenhouse gas emissions where increased levels of ammonia could pose a health or environmental risk.

**Working Principles:**

The POLYSENSE Nh3 sensor operates on the principle of electrochemical detection. When the sensor comes into contact with ammonia gas, a chemical reaction occurs that produces an electric current proportional to the concentration of NH3. The integrated signal processing unit interprets this current and composes a corresponding digital output.

**Installation Guide:**

1. Choose a mounting location - The sensor should be mounted at the typical height where NH3 exposure is most likely to occur.

2. Fix the unit - Use screws or alternative fixing materials (depending on the mounting surface) to secure the device.

3. Electrical Wiring - Connect the sensor to the power supply and LoRaWAN network according to the standardized system diagram provided.

**LoRaWAN Details:**

The POLYSENSE Nh3 sensor incorporates LoRa (Long Range) WAN technology, enabling long-range, low-power communication with IoT devices. With its built-in LoRaWAN module, the sensor wirelessly transmits NH3 concentration data to a connected gateway, then to a data server or cloud platform where it can be monitored and analyzed.

**Power Consumption:**

Designed for low power consumption, the POLYSENSE Nh3 Sensor typically draws around 15 mA in active mode and 3 Î¼A in sleep mode. Thus, it's ideal for remote or hard-to-reach areas where constant power supply is not guaranteed.

**Use Cases:**

1. Industrial Safety - Regular monitoring of ammonia levels in factories, refrigeration systems, treatment plants can help prevent exposure that could impact workers' health.

2. Air Quality Monitoring - Municipalities and environmental departments can use these sensors to monitor ambient NH3 levels, crucial for health and air quality index calculation.

3. Agriculture - In agricultural settings, it can help monitor potential NH3 emissions from livestock farming, reducing environmental impacts.

**Limitations:**

1. Interference - Other gases can sometimes impact the sensor's ability to accurately measure ammonia concentration.

2. Ambient Conditions - Temperature and humidity fluctuations can influence the sensitivity and accuracy of the sensor.
