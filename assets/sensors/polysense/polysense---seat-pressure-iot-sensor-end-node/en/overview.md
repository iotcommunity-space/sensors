DOCUMENT TITLE: Technical Overview of the POLYSENSE - Seat Pressure IoT Sensor End Node (POLYSENSE)

1. WORKING PRINCPLES:
POLYSENSE Seat Pressure IoT Sensor End Node is designed to measure the pressure change caused by the weight applied on seats. The sensor leverages advanced MEMS (Micro-electromechanical systems) technology, which facilitates high precision in pressure measurement. It works based on piezoelectric principles, where mechanical pressure leads to voltage generation, indicating pressure intensity. Data collected by this sensor are transmitted to an IoT platform for analysis and further utilization.

2. INSTALLATION GUIDE:
Installation of the POLYSENSE IoT sensor is straightforward. The sensor should be securely affixed to the seat surface where pressure will be applied. Ensure the device is attached to a clean, smooth, and flat surface for adequate sensitivity and durability. After successful positioning and affixing, connect the sensor to your IoT configuration (Edge device, gateway, or direct-to-cloud) following the manufacturer's instructions.

3. LoRaWAN DETAILS:
POLYSENSE Seat Pressure IoT Sensor End Node utilizes LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) technology for data transmission, offering low-power, long-range communication. It adheres to LoRaWAN protocol specifications, contributing to its interoperability. This sensor can connect to any standard LoRaWAN network, making it suitable for both indoor and outdoor applications.

4. POWER CONSUMPTION:
The sensor operates on a low power consumption model, praising IoT prerequisites for extended battery life. Under normal operating conditions, the sensor's power consumption status is at the micro-amps level, thus contributing to high energy efficiency. However, power consumption may vary depending on networking conditions and frequency of sensor data transmissions.

5. USE CASES:
The POLYSENSE Seat Pressure IoT Sensor End Node is versatile and finds usage in a variety of scenarios. These include:

- Smart Building Management: Monitoring seat occupancy in shared spaces, meeting rooms, libraries, etc., to optimize space management and cleaning schedules.
  
- Health Care: Used in hospitals or care homes to monitor seat occupancy for patients, hence ensuring quick response during emergencies.
  
- Transportation Industry: Monitoring occupancy in public transportation systems to optimize operations and maintain social distancing norms.

6. LIMITATIONS:
Though POLYSENSE Seat Pressure IoT Sensor End Node offers precise data, there are some limitations:

- Environmental Factors: The sensor may not work optimally under extreme environmental conditions like high-temperature variations, humidity, or moisture.

- Surface Material: The pressure sensitivity and data accuracy can be compromised depending on the seat material's hardness or softness.

- Data Transmission Range: Although LoRaWAN enables long-range transmission, physical obstacles such as walls or metal surfaces can affect the connectivity and transmission range.

- Power: Limited by battery life, especially under intense use or if the data transmission frequency is very high. 

NOTE: For maintaining the sensor's operational efficiency, regular maintenance and proper installation are recommended as per the manufacturer's guidelines.
