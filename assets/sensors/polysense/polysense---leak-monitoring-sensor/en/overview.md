# POLYSENSE - Leak Monitoring Sensor

## Overview

The POLYSENSE Leak Monitoring Sensor is an advanced IoT device utilized in the detection and monitoring of liquid leaks. The device uses state-of-the-art sensor technology to detect leakage in a wide range of environments, from industrial piping systems to residential plumbing.

## Working Principles

The sensor operates by utilizing capacitive sensing technology. When the sensor comes into contact with water, a change in capacitance occurs due to the varying dielectric properties of water and air. This change is detected by the sensor's logic, which then triggers an alert.

## Installation Guide

1. Choose a suitable location for the sensor, preferably a place where a leak is likely to occur. It is typically installed near water pipes, fittings, and joints.
2. Fix the sensor at the location using the provided installation tools. Ensure that the sensor pad is touching the potential water leakage area.
3. Connect the device as per the schematic diagram provided in the user manual.
4. Following a successful installation, carry out test runs to ensure the sensor is functioning as specified.

## LoRaWAN Details

LoRaWAN (Low Range Wide Area Network) integration provides long-distance communication ability, allowing the sensor to transmit leak detection data over a large area. The sensor uses LoRaWAN protocol Class A which is designed for low power consumption and scalability. Its frequency range and data rate are determined by the LoRaWAN standard in the geographical region the device is used in.

## Power Consumption

The POLYSENSE sensor is designed with power efficiency in mind. The device operates mainly in idle mode and only consumes significant power when a change in capacitance is detected, thanks to its ultra-low power LoRa technology. The exact power consumption can vary based on the triggering frequency and the usage of heartbeat messages, but the device can typically operate for several years with one battery due to its optimized power management and low power operations.

## Use Cases

POLYSENSE Leak Monitoring Sensor is highly versatile and can be used in a multitude of environments:

1. Industrial Pipelines: It can detect leaks in large industrial pipelines early, helping prevent major accidents and financial losses due to water damage.
2. Water Tanks: It can check for tank overflow, aiding in water conservation.
3. Residential and Commercial Buildings: The sensor can detect minor leaks in building plumbing systems, preventing major damage and high repair costs.
4. Data Centres and Server Rooms: The sensor can protect equipment from liquid damage by detecting leaks from air conditioning systems or pipes.

## Limitations

Despite its high efficiency, there are a few limitations:

1. The sensor can only detect leaks when the leak reaches the sensor's physical location.
2. The sensor is not suitable for applications where the substance that may leak could damage or compromise the sensor.
3. The sensor is highly sensitive, so it may sometimes detect false positives in damp or high humidity conditions.
4. Although the sensor is designed for longevity, the battery life can significantly reduce if frequently triggered or utilized in harsh conditions.
5. Range of LoRaWAN communication may be limited due to geographical obstructions or interference. 

Despite these limitations, the POLYSENSE Leak Monitoring Sensor is a reliable and efficient method for detecting and monitoring leaks in diverse scenarios.
