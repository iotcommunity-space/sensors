Document: POLYSENSE - Rainfall Sensor (POLYSENSE) - Technical Overview

----
1. Overview:

POLYSENSE Rainfall Sensor is an industry-grade sensor designed to provide accurate and efficient rainfall measurement in various environmental conditions. The sensor uses a high-quality tipping-bucket mechanism that measures the volume of rainfall and reports it via LoRaWAN (Long-Range Wide Area Network).

2. Working Principle:

The POLYSENSE rainfall sensor operates using the tipping-bucket mechanism. Here, rainwater funnels into the sensor and gets accumulated in a small bucket. Once a pre-defined threshold is met, the bucket tips. Each tip further sends an electrical signal to the sensor's microprocessor. The microprocessor then converts this signal into accumulated rainfall data. The data is then transmitted via integrated LoRaWAN module to the associated network for decoding and interpretation.

3. Installation Guide:

For optimal accuracy, the sensor should be installed in an open area with no tree cover or buildings causing rainfall shadow. It should be positioned flat and securely fastened to avoid tipping. The step-by-step installation guide is as follows:

- Mount the sensor on a sturdy, flat surface.
- Connect the sensor to the LoRaWAN module through the provided connector.
- Test the connectivity on your LoRa network.
- After successful connection, firmly secure all components to prevent any damage from environmental elements.

4. LoRaWAN Details:

When connected via LoRaWAN, the POLYSENSE Sensor supports a range up to 5 km in suburban areas, and up to 15 km in open rural areas. The sensor uses proprietary data formatting, and the decode library is provided within the purchase package.

5. Power Consumption:

The POLYSENSE Rainfall Sensor operates using a 3.6V non-rechargeable battery. The superior low power consumption design ensures an extended battery life of up to 10 years, depending on the transmission interval and environmental conditions. 

6. Use Cases:

The POLYSENSE Rainfall Sensor is suitable for numerous applications such as:

- Meteorological Stations: For accurate local rainfall data.
- Agriculture and Farming: To monitor rainfall for irrigation and crop management.
- Flood and Drought Monitoring: To provide early warnings and reduce environmental impact.
- Environmental Research: For various ecological studies.

7. Limitations:

While the POLYSENSE Rainfall Sensor is designed for a range of environments, there are some limitations:

- It requires clear sky exposure for accurate readings.
- The sensor may not perform optimally in extreme freezing conditions where water is likely to freeze.
- It is sensitive to movement; therefore, it must be securely mounted.
