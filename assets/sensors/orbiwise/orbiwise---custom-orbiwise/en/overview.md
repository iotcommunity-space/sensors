## Technical Overview: ORBIWISE - Custom Orbiwise

**1. Overview**

The Custom ORBIWISE is a comprehensive IoT platform provided by the Swiss company ORBIWISE, which serves as a powerful LoRaWAN network server allowing an effective management of IoT networks. The server is compatible with many manufacturers producing LoRaWAN devices, thus providing opportunities for various IoT solutions.

**2. Working Principles**

The ORBIWISE platform operates predominantly on the globally standardized low-power wide area network (LPWAN) technology - LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network). It receives packets from LoRaWAN devices, interprets the packets, and transfers them to connected applications. This server also manages bidirectional communications with the devices, assuring command execution and MAC layer settings like Adaptive data rate (ADR).

**3. Installation Guide**

The installation process of ORBIWISE is straightforward: 

- Download and install the ORBIWISE software on the chosen server.
- Connect the server to the LoRaWAN Gateway.
- Launch the ORBIWISE software.
- Finally, configure the software to connect it with your specific IoT devices.

**4. LoRaWAN Details**

ORBIWISE operates on the LoRaWAN protocol; a medium access control (MAC) layer protocol for managing communication between LPWAN gateways and end-node devices. It uses an unlicensed, multi-channel digital packet radio to facilitate communication at different frequencies around the world (865-867MHz in India, 902-928MHz in North America, and 863-870MHz in Europe).

**5. Power Consumption**

ORBIWAN boasts low-power consumption due to the inherent design of LoRaWAN technology, aimed at saving energy while still securing long-range data transfer capability. This makes it a perfect solution for battery-operated IoT devices that require reliable, extended functioning without a frequent need for battery replacement.

**6. Use Cases**

The versatile ORBIWISE platform suits various industrial sectors: 

- In agriculture, it helps manage and monitor soil moisture, temperature, pH level, and more via connected sensors to improve crop yield. 
- In utilities, it aids automated meter reading and anomalies detection in energy, water, and gas usage. 
- In smart cities, it supports management of waste collection, parking, street lights, etc. 
- In environment monitoring, it alerts about flood, fire, pollution, etc. via connected sensors. 

**7. Limitations**

Despite its several advantages, ORBIWISE has certain limitations:

- Accommodates only devices compatible with LoRaWAN protocol.
- Requires adequate network signal for proper functioning; can suffer in areas with poor network signal. 
- The data rate and message size are limited due to the LoRaWAN protocol.
- May not function optimally in environments with high interference such as urban areas or thickly constructed spaces.

In conclusion, the ORBIWISE platform serves as a robust solution for IoT networks, offering end-to-end management of LoRaWAN devices. Its simplicity, versatility, and low power consumption make it appealing for various industrial use-cases. It is, however, important to consider the limitations related to network compatibility and signal quality before deciding on deployment at the desired location.
