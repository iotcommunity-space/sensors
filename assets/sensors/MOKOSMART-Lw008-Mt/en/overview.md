# MOKOSMART Lw008-MT Technical Overview

## Introduction

The MOKOSMART Lw008-MT is a LoRaWAN-enabled asset tracking device designed for accurate and efficient monitoring of various assets across both indoor and outdoor environments. It offers robust connectivity, low power consumption, and high precision location data, making it ideal for supply chain management, equipment tracking, and logistics applications.

## Working Principles

The core functionality of the Lw008-MT relies on a combination of GPS/GLONASS for location tracking and LoRaWAN for data communication. The device periodically collects location data via its GPS module and transmits this information to a LoRaWAN gateway using the LoRa radio technology. This ensures long-range communication with low power consumption, making it suitable for remote monitoring applications.

1. **Location Tracking**: Utilizes GPS/GLONASS for obtaining precise geographical coordinates.
2. **Communication**: Employs LoRaWAN protocol which enables long-range, low-power wireless transmission.
3. **Data Transmission**: Periodically sends asset location and status data to a LoRaWAN network server.
4. **Battery Optimization**: Features power-saving modes that adjust the frequency of GPS data collection and communication intervals.

## Installation Guide

Installing the MOKOSMART Lw008-MT involves several key steps:

1. **Device Activation**: Power on the device by pressing the designated button for a few seconds until the LED indicator blinks, signaling the device is operational.
2. **Configuration**: Use the MOKOSMART configuration application or tool to set up the device parameters such as the LoRaWAN region, frequency, and data transmission intervals. This often involves connecting the device to a computer or smartphone via Bluetooth.
3. **Network Registration**: Connect the device to a LoRaWAN gateway. Ensure the device's DevEUI, AppEUI, and AppKey are correctly entered in the network server.
4. **Placement**: Securely attach the device to the asset using the built-in mounting options. Ensure the device has a clear view of the sky to optimize GPS signal reception.
5. **Testing**: Perform a test run to verify data is being correctly captured and transmitted to the network server.

## LoRaWAN Details

- **Frequency Bands**: The Lw008-MT supports multiple LoRaWAN bands including EU868, US915, and AS923, among others, allowing for global usage.
- **Activation Methods**: Supports both Over-The-Air Activation (OTAA) and Activation By Personalization (ABP) for network registration.
- **Data Rate**: The device supports multiple data rates, which can be dynamically adjusted based on network conditions to optimize communication efficiency.

## Power Consumption

The MOKOSMART Lw008-MT boasts excellent power efficiency, whether in active use or standby mode. Below is an overview of the power consumption characteristics:

- **Active Tracking (GPS On)**: Varies from 10 to 40 mA depending on active data transmission and GPS usage.
- **Sleep Mode (No GPS)**: Less than 15 Î¼A, significantly extending battery life.
- **Battery Life**: Powered by a replaceable lithium battery providing up to several months of operation depending on configuration and use case.

## Use Cases

- **Supply Chain Management**: Ensures real-time monitoring of goods during transit, offering data on location and movement patterns.
- **Logistics and Transport**: Tracks vehicles and fleets, optimizing routes and reducing operational costs.
- **Industrial Asset Management**: Monitors heavy machinery and equipment within large industrial facilities, improving resource allocation and maintenance scheduling.
- **Personal Property Tracking**: Secures personal assets, providing alerts on unauthorized movement.

## Limitations

While the MOKOSMART Lw008-MT excels in many areas, there are limitations to consider:

- **Signal Obstruction**: Requires a clear line of sight to GPS satellites; performance may be impacted in dense urban areas or indoor settings without adequate window exposure.
- **Battery Dependency**: Limited by battery capacity, necessitating regular monitoring and replacement or recharging for continuous operation.
- **Network Availability**: Relies on the presence of a LoRaWAN infrastructure, which may not be present in all geographic regions.

The MOKOSMART Lw008-MT is a sophisticated and highly adaptable tool for asset tracking, designed to provide essential data across a variety of applications with high efficiency. Understanding its capabilities and limitations allows organizations to deploy it effectively, optimizing their asset tracking requirements.
