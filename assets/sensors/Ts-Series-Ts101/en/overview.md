# Technical Overview for Ts Series - Ts101 Temperature Sensor

## Introduction
The Ts Series - Ts101 is a precise and robust temperature sensor designed for various industrial and commercial applications. Featuring wireless connectivity through LoRaWAN, the Ts101 offers long-range communication capabilities coupled with low power consumption, making it an ideal choice for remote monitoring solutions.

## Working Principles
The Ts101 operates using a high-sensitivity thermistor to measure temperature variations in its environment. It converts the thermal input into a resistive signal which is then processed to an equivalent digital output. The sensor's digital output can cover a wide range of temperatures, providing accurate readings in real-time. The internal microcontroller processes this data and transmits it over the LoRaWAN network to a central server or cloud platform, where the data can be monitored and analyzed.

## Installation Guide
1. **Site Selection**: Choose a location within the operational range of the LoRaWAN gateway. Ensure that the area has stable environmental conditions to maintain the accuracy of the readings.

2. **Mounting**: Secure the sensor using the provided mounting bracket. It can be installed on walls, poles, or any stable structure to ensure accurate detections. Avoid locations with direct exposure to heat sources or extreme weather conditions.

3. **Power On**: The Ts101 is battery-powered. Insert the included lithium batteries into the designated battery compartment ensuring correct polarity. The sensor will power on automatically.

4. **Network Enrollment**: To connect the Ts101 to your LoRaWAN network, ensure it is within communication range. Follow these steps:
   - Access the network server's device onboarding portal.
   - Enter the unique DevEUI, AppEUI, and AppKey (provided within the sensor's packaging).
   - Power cycle the sensor if necessary, to trigger the join request.
   
5. **Calibration (Optional)**: For enhanced precision, the sensor can be calibrated using standard environment references as per batch calibration protocols.
