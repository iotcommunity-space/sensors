#### Working Principles
The ATIM Dind88 operates by continuously monitoring and capturing environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, and additional specific sensor inputs, depending on the configuration. The device incorporates a low-power microcontroller and a LoRaWAN transceiver, which ensures efficient data transmission over long distances with minimal power usage. The Dind88 processes on-device data, converting it to digital form, and transmits this data at preset intervals to a LoRaWAN gateway. The data is then directed to a cloud-based platform for further analysis, visualization, or integration into other systems.
