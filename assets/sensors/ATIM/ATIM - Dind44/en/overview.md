# Technical Overview: ATIM - Dind44 IoT Sensor

## Introduction
The ATIM Dind44 is an advanced industrial-grade LoRaWAN sensor designed for remote temperature and humidity monitoring. Engineered for robust IoT applications, it is suitable for diverse environments, including smart agriculture, supply chain logistics, and environmental monitoring.

## Working Principles
The ATIM Dind44 operates based on capacitive humidity sensors and semiconductor temperature sensors. It uses LoRaWAN communication protocol to transmit collected data over long distances with low power consumption. The device periodically sends measurements to a LoRaWAN gateway, which then forwards this information to a cloud server or local network for processing and analysis.

Key features include:
- **Capacitive Humidity Sensing**: Converts humidity levels into a digital signal.
- **Semiconductor Temperature Sensor**: Provides accurate temperature readings.
- **LoRaWAN Protocol**: Enables long-range communication with minimal power usage.

## Installation Guide
