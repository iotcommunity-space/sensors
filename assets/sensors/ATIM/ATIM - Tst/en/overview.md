### Technical Overview for ATIM - Tst (ATIM)

#### Introduction

The ATIM - Tst (ATIM) is a versatile and reliable IoT sensor designed for various industrial and environmental monitoring applications. It leverages LoRaWAN technology for wireless data transmission, providing long-range communication and low power consumption, making it ideal for remote and difficult-to-access locations.

#### Working Principles

The ATIM - Tst sensor operates on the principle of LoRa (Long Range) modulation, which allows for robust long-distance communication with low power requirements. The device continuously monitors environmental parameters, such as temperature, humidity, and pressure, depending on the specific sensor configuration, and transmits the collected data to a LoRaWAN gateway. The data can then be routed to a cloud server or a centralized IoT platform for analysis, monitoring, and decision-making.

#### Installation Guide

1. **Pre-Installation Checks:**
   - Ensure the ATIM sensor package is complete and undamaged.
   - Verify compatibility with the planned monitoring environment.
   - Ensure a clear line of sight to the nearest LoRaWAN gateway for optimal communication.

2. **Placement:**
   - Select an appropriate location that is representative of the area you wish to monitor.
   - Avoid placing the sensor near metal objects or inside enclosures that might interfere with signal transmission.
   
3. **Mounting:**
   - Use the provided mounting kit to fasten the sensor to a pole, wall, or designated structure.
   - Ensure the sensor is mounted securely to avoid displacement due to weather or external factors.

4. **Powering the Device:**
   - Insert batteries as per specifications (typically AA or 3.6V lithium).
   - For models with external power options, connect to a suitable power source.
   
5. **Configuration:**
   - Use a compatible NFC or Bluetooth device to configure the sensor settings.
   - Set the desired sampling rate, transmission intervals, and activate the device via the companion mobile or desktop application.

6. **Testing:**
   - Conduct a preliminary test to ensure the device is transmitting data correctly.
   - Check connectivity to the LoRaWAN network and ensure data integrity.
