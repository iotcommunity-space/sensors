## Working Principles

The MILESIGHT CT101 is engineered to regulate ambient temperature with high precision. It operates by continuously monitoring the environmental conditions and making real-time adjustments to heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems to maintain optimal comfort levels.

- **Temperature Sensing:** It is equipped with an internal sensor to measure room temperature accurately. These readings guide the thermostat in maintaining set temperature points.
- **User Interface:** The 2.4-inch display and capacitive touch buttons facilitate easy configuration and manual overrides.
- **Automated HVAC Control:** Based on predefined schedules or manual settings, the CT101 modulates HVAC operations to ensure energy efficiency while preserving user comfort.

## Installation Guide

### Prerequisites

- Ensure LoRaWAN coverage at the installation site.
- Compatible HVAC system for seamless integration.
- Adequate power source for device operation.

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Location Selection:** Install the thermostat on an interior wall away from direct sunlight, drafts, or heat sources for accurate temperature measurement.
2. **Mounting:** Affix the mounting plate to the wall using screws. Ensure it is level for optimal aesthetic and functional alignment.
3. **Wiring:** Connect the CT101 to the HVAC system using the terminals provided. Refer to the deviceâ€™s wiring diagram to match terminal functions accurately.
4. **Powering Up:** Once wired, attach the thermostat to the mounting plate, ensuring secure contact with the power supply.
5. **Device Configuration:** Use the touch interface to set up the timezone, date, and user preferences.
6. **LoRaWAN Network Configuration:** Enter the LoRaWAN keys (DevEUI, AppEUI, AppKey) via the configuration menu or using the dedicated management tool to connect to the network.
7. **Testing:** Verify functionality by adjusting the temperature settings and reviewing the HVAC response.

## LoRaWAN Details
