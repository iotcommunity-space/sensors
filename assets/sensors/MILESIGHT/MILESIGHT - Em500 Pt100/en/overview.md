# Technical Overview for MILESIGHT EM500 Pt100 Temperature Sensor

## Overview
The MILESIGHT EM500 Pt100 is a robust and high-precision temperature sensor developed for a wide range of industrial and environmental applications. Designed for harsh conditions, it features an IP67-rated enclosure that assures its durability and reliability.

## Working Principles
The EM500 Pt100 leverages the properties of the Pt100 resistance temperature detector (RTD), which operates on the principle that the resistance of the platinum sensor increases with temperature. This high-accuracy sensor can track temperature fluctuations with a precision typically around ±0.15°C. The sensor converts resistance changes into temperature readings, which are then transmitted using LoRaWAN technology.

## Installation Guide
1. **Site Preparation**: Identify an appropriate location for the sensor, ensuring it is not exposed to elements that could affect the measurements, like direct sunlight or excessive moisture unless necessary for the monitoring scenario.

2. **Mounting the Sensor**: Use the provided mounting kit to secure the sensor. Ensure the probe is securely positioned in the area where temperature monitoring is required.

3. **Connection Setup**: Using the cable provided, connect the sensor to the power supply or to the external port if using an external power source.

4. **LoRaWAN Configuration**:
   - Ensure the gateway is within range.
   - Power on the device and use the MILESIGHT IoT platform or the provided configuration tools to configure device parameters such as Network ID, App Key, and other relevant LoRaWAN settings.
   
5. **Testing**: Verify that the sensor readings are accurate using a reference thermometer if possible.

## LoRaWAN Details
The EM500 Pt100 is capable of operating on standard LoRaWAN networks, supporting the following features:

- **Frequency Bands**: It supports various frequency bands including EU868 and US915, adaptable to regional requirements.
- **Data Rate**: Operates across different data rates depending on configuration (DR0 to DR5 typically).
- **Range**: Up to 10 km line of sight in rural areas and 2 km in urban settings.
- **Network Compatibility**: The sensor can integrate seamlessly with existing LoRaWAN gateways and network servers.
- **Security**: Implements AES-128 encryption to ensure data is securely transmitted.

## Power Consumption
The EM500 Pt100 is designed for low-power operation:

- **Battery Life**: Powered by a replaceable 19000mAh Li-SOCl2 battery, which can sustain up to 10 years depending on usage and transmission configurations.
- **Power-saving Modes**: Supports configurable transmission intervals to optimize battery life.

## Use Cases
The EM500 Pt100 is versatile and suitable for:

- **Environmental Monitoring**: Track ambient temperature in remote natural reserves or climate-sensitive installations.
- **Industrial Processes**: Measure temperatures in manufacturing or chemical processing environments.
- **Agricultural Applications**: Monitor the temperature of soil or greenhouses.
- **Food and Beverage**: Ensures temperature control in storage and transportation, compliant with HACCP standards.

## Limitations
Despite its robust design, the EM500 Pt100 has some limitations:

- **Line of Sight**: The LoRaWAN communication may require an unobstructed path to achieve maximum range.
- **Calibration Needs**: Regular calibration is necessary to maintain accuracy over extensive periods.
- **Installation Environment**: Its performance might degrade in extremely corrosive or exceptionally humid environments without additional protective measures.
- **Data Delay**: Due to the nature of LoRaWAN, data transmission might not be real-time, making it less suitable for applications requiring instantaneous feedback.

In summary, the MILESIGHT EM500 Pt100 is a high-precision, durable sensor solution ideal for extensive temperature monitoring applications across diverse sectors, with careful consideration of its limitations and installation environment to ensure optimal performance.
