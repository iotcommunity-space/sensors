## Technical Overview for MILESIGHT - EM500-SWL

The MILESIGHT EM500-SWL is a robust, versatile submersible water level sensor designed for applications requiring reliable water level monitoring. It leverages LoRaWAN® technology to ensure long-range, low-power data transmission, making it ideal for remote environmental monitoring scenarios.

### Working Principles

The EM500-SWL sensor operates using piezoresistive measurement principles. It includes a diaphragm that flexes under the pressure exerted by the water above it. This physical deformation of the diaphragm is converted into an electrical signal, which is directly proportional to the water level. The sensor is designed with high sensitivity and accuracy to detect water levels precisely, making it suitable for a variety of environments.

### LoRaWAN Details

- **Protocol**: LoRaWAN 1.0.3 Class A/C
- **Frequency Bands**: Supports Asia 923, EU868, US915, and other regional ISM bands.
- **Communication Range**: Up to 10 kilometers in line-of-sight conditions.
- **Data Transmission Interval**: Configurable, from a few minutes to several hours, depending on the application needs.

### Installation Guide

1. **Site Selection**: Choose a strategic location where the sensor can be submerged, ensuring it is free from potential debris and secure from strong currents.
   
2. **Mounting**: Secure the sensor using its cable; the robust design allows it to be submerged without requiring complex fixation. Use appropriate tools or fixtures if necessary to prevent displacement.

3. **Configuration**: Use the NFC or USB connection to configure the sensor settings such as LoRaWAN parameters, data transmission intervals, and calibration specifics using the MILESIGHT IoT Cloud or third-party network servers.

4. **Submersion**: Once configured, fully submerge the sensor to the desired start depth ensuring full immersion, while keeping the connected end above water for optimal communication.

5. **Antenna Positioning**: The antenna should be positioned to maximize signal reception, considering environmental factors that may impede LoRaWAN transmission such as obstacles or electromagnetic interference.

### Power Consumption

The EM500-SWL is equipped with a long-lasting, replaceable lithium battery designed for minimal power usage:

- **Battery Type**: 19Ah Li-SOCl2 battery.
- **Operational Lifetime**: Up to 10 years from a full charge depending on the data transmission interval and environmental conditions.
- **Power Saving**: Utilizes advanced sleep modes to reduce power consumption between transmission intervals.

### Use Cases

- **Groundwater Monitoring**: Used extensively in environmental engineering for groundwater level measurement in wells and boreholes.
- **Reservoir Management**: Effective for monitoring water levels in reservoirs and dams to help with water resource management.
- **Flood Prevention**: Monitors real-time water levels to give early warning in flood-prone areas, aiding disaster management.
- **Agricultural Irrigation**: Assists in optimizing irrigation schedules by monitoring water levels in irrigation systems.

### Limitations

- **Installation Environment**: As a submersible device, it cannot be utilized for above-water level measurements or in non-liquid environments.
- **Signal Interference**: While the device operates effectively over long distances, signal transmission can be affected by dense urban settings or heavy-duty construction sites.
- **Battery Replacement**: Although designed for longevity, the internal battery eventually requires replacement, which might necessitate service interruption depending on location and accessibility.
- **Temperature Sensitivity**: Extreme temperatures outside the rated range of -40°C to 85°C may affect sensor performance and longevity.

In conclusion, the MILESIGHT EM500-SWL offers a reliable and durable solution for monitoring water levels with advanced data communication capabilities and a streamlined deployment process suited for varied environmental monitoring applications.
