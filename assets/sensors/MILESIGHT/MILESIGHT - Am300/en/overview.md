2. **Light**: The built-in light sensor captures ambient light intensity, which can be crucial for applications in lighting control and energy savings.

3. **CO₂ and TVOC**: Equipped with dedicated sensors, the AM300 provides reliable measurements of CO₂ levels and Total Volatile Organic Compounds in the air, essential for maintaining indoor air quality.

4. **Barometric Pressure**: The barometric pressure sensor offers insights into atmospheric pressure changes, which can affect weather predictions and HVAC system performance.

The AM300 gathers data from these sensors and communicates it via LoRaWAN, ensuring long-range data transmission with low power consumption.

### Installation Guide

1. **Site Selection**: Choose a location that represents the area you wish to monitor without obstructions that could affect sensor readings, such as direct sunlight or ventilation outlets.

2. **Mounting**: Using the provided mounting kit, install the AM300 securely to a wall or ceiling. Ensure it is placed at an adequate height to avoid tampering while maintaining exposure to the ambient environment.

3. **Power Connection**: The AM300 can be powered by standard AA alkaline batteries or an external power supply. For continuous monitoring, external power is recommended.

4. **Configuration**: Configure the sensor using the dedicated MILESIGHT configuration tool. Adjust the measurement intervals, data transmission settings, and threshold alerts according to your application needs.

5. **Network Integration**: Ensure that the AM300 is correctly integrated into your LoRaWAN network. This includes confirming network connectivity and ensuring that it aligns with the network server settings (frequency, data rate, etc.).

### LoRaWAN Details
