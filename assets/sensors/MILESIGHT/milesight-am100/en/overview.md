## Technical Overview: MILESIGHT AM100

### Introduction

The MILESIGHT AM100 is a compact, multi-functional sensor designed for interior environmental monitoring. It primarily targets applications that require detailed and reliable indoor air quality assessments, such as in smart buildings or offices. Combining several sensor capabilities, it allows for continuous monitoring of temperature, humidity, ambient light, CO2 levels, TVOC (Total Volatile Organic Compounds), barometric pressure, and motion detection.

### Working Principles

The working principle of the MILESIGHT AM100 revolves around its embedded sensors that capture various environmental parameters. Here's a breakdown of these sensors:

- **Temperature and Humidity Sensor**: Utilizes a digital sensing element that measures humidity and temperature, often with accuracy rates of ±0.2°C and ±2% RH.
- **Ambient Light Sensor**: Converts light intensity into a digital signal for precise ambient light measurement.
- **CO2 Sensor**: Employs Non-Dispersive Infrared (NDIR) technology, a reliable method of detecting carbon dioxide presence with high accuracy.
- **TVOC Sensor**: Uses a MEMS sensor technology to detect volatile organic compounds in the air.
- **Barometric Pressure Sensor**: Measures atmospheric pressure by detecting the minute changes in electrical charge generated by air pressure variations.
- **PIR Motion Sensor**: Passive Infrared sensor detects motion by measuring changes in infrared radiation.

### Installation Guide

#### Step 1: Unboxing
- Begin by unboxing the sensor and ensuring all components are present and intact. These typically include the sensor unit, mounting accessories, and a quick start guide.

#### Step 2: Battery Installation
- Access the battery compartment on the sensor and insert the batteries according to the polarity indicated. Verify the contacts are secure for reliable power performance.

#### Step 3: Configuration
- Connect to the sensor wirelessly via the MILESIGHT configuration app or software. Configure the network settings and sensor parameters, such as data transmission intervals and specific sensor thresholds.

#### Step 4: Mounting
- Choose a suitable location that is central to the area you wish to monitor. Avoid direct exposure to heat sources, excessive moisture, or physical barriers as they might affect sensor readings.
- Use the mounting accessories supplied to attach the sensor to a wall or ceiling.

#### Step 5: Network Setup
- Follow the manual instructions to connect the sensor to the LoRaWAN gateway. Ensure that the sensor is within the signal range of the network.

### LoRaWAN Details

The MILESIGHT AM100 operates on the LoRaWAN protocol, a Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) specification designed for wireless communication over long distances. It supports the following:

- **Frequency Bands**: Adaptable to various regional frequency plans such as EU868, US915, and AU915.
- **Data Rates**: Utilizes adaptive data rate (ADR) for optimizing sensor data transmission.
- **Network Class**: Functions as a Class A LoRa device, which is energy-efficient and suitable for asynchronous communication.

### Power Consumption

The MILESIGHT AM100 is designed with low power consumption in mind, powered by replaceable batteries with a lifespan typically extending up to 5 years, depending on the transmission frequency and environmental conditions. Power-saving algorithms are employed to extend operational life while maintaining accurate data output.

### Use Cases

- **Indoor Air Quality Monitoring**: Ideal for monitoring CO2 and TVOC levels in offices, schools, or homes to maintain healthy air quality.
- **Smart Building Management**: Integrates with building management systems to optimize HVAC operations based on real-time environmental readings.
- **Workplace Safety and Compliance**: Ensures occupational health standards are maintained by continuously monitoring ambient conditions and alerts for deviations.

### Limitations

- **Range**: As a LoRaWAN device, performance is contingent on being within range of a LoRa gateway. Obstructions and building materials may affect signal quality.
- **Accuracy Dependencies**: Environmental extremes, such as heavy dust presence or high moisture, may influence the precision of sensor readings.
- **Battery Dependency**: While designed for longevity, the sensor's operational lifespan is reliant on the battery life, which can be subject to gradual depletion.
- **Initial Setup Complexity**: Requires technical knowledge for LoRaWAN configurations and network integration, which may pose a hurdle for non-technical users.

The MILESIGHT AM100 is a versatile tool for modern indoor environments, providing essential data for intelligent management systems, enhancing comfort, and promoting health standards. However, it requires careful installation and network setup to maximize its capabilities.
