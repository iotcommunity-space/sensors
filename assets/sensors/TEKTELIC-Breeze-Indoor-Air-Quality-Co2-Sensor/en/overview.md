## Technical Overview of TEKTELIC - Breeze Indoor Air Quality CO2 Sensor

### Overview

The TEKTELIC Breeze is an advanced indoor air quality sensor specifically designed to monitor environmental parameters such as CO2 concentration, temperature, humidity, and optional VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds). Utilizing LoRaWAN technology, the Breeze offers long-range wireless communication, making it ideal for various applications that require real-time air quality monitoring within buildings.

### Working Principles

The Breeze sensor employs Non-Dispersive Infrared (NDIR) technology to accurately measure CO2 levels. NDIR sensors are renowned for their precision and reliability in detecting gases. The sensor works by directing infrared light through a sample of the air while measuring the intensity of the light that passes through. Since CO2 molecules absorb a specific wavelength, the resultant reduction in light intensity indicates the concentration of CO2 in the air. Additional environmental parameters like temperature and humidity are measured using integrated digital sensors.

### Installation Guide

1. **Location Selection**: 
   - Place the sensor in an area representative of normal conditions. Avoid locations near windows, doors, or vents.
   - Ensure the installation location has good air circulation and is away from any potential sources of interference or obstruction.

2. **Mounting**:
   - Use the provided mounting hardware for wall or ceiling installations. Ensure the sensor is mounted vertically for optimal performance.
   - Maintain a distance of at least one meter from any large objects to avoid skewed readings.

3. **Power Supply**:
   - Depending on the model, the Breeze can be battery-operated or connected to an external power source via a power adapter.
   - For battery-powered models, ensure that the batteries are correctly installed.

4. **Network Configuration**:
   - Configure the device to connect to a LoRaWAN network following the provided instructions.
   - Ensure the sensor's DevEUI, AppEUI, and AppKey settings are correctly input into your network server.

### LoRaWAN Details

- **Frequency Bands**: The Breeze sensor supports global LoRaWAN frequency bands, including EU868, US915, and others, making it suitable for various global deployments.
- **Data Transmission**: The device periodically transmits data to a LoRaWAN gateway, from where it can be integrated into an IoT platform for analysis and visualization.
- **Security**: Data transmission is secured with AES-128 encryption ensuring data integrity and security across the network.

### Power Consumption

- **Battery Life**: For battery-operated models, the device can achieve up to 10 years of battery life under typical conditions, depending on configuration settings such as reporting frequency and environment.
- **Power Efficiency**: Power usage is optimized through efficient data sampling and transmission strategies, ensuring prolonged operation and minimal maintenance.

### Use Cases

- **Commercial Buildings**: Maintain optimal air quality in offices to enhance employee health and productivity.
- **Educational Institutions**: Monitor classroom air quality to ensure a conducive learning environment.
- **Healthcare Facilities**: Ensure air quality standards are met to maximize patient comfort and safety.
- **Residential Homes**: Track indoor air quality for better health and wellbeing in living areas.

### Limitations

- **Installation Environment**: Extreme environments or incorrect placement can affect sensor accuracy. Locations with high airflow, exposure to moisture, or excessive dust should be avoided.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: While the sensor provides periodic updates, it may not capture rapid fluctuations in air quality in real-time due to the transmission intervals.
- **Network Dependency**: Effective operation requires a properly configured and maintained LoRaWAN gateway and network infrastructure.

The TEKTELIC Breeze Indoor Air Quality CO2 Sensor is an invaluable tool for maintaining and improving indoor air quality across various settings. Understanding its operational parameters and installation requirements ensures optimal performance and longevity.
