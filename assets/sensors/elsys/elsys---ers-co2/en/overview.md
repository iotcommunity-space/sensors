Overview:
The ELSYS - ERS CO2 is an IoT sensor designed specifically for indoor measurement of Carbon Dioxide (CO2) concentration along with monitoring various other environmental parameters such as temperature and humidity. This device operates using LoRaWAN technology, which allows long-range communication of the collected data to the central server or cloud, in addition of being reliable and energy-efficient. 

Working Principle:
The ELSYS - ERS CO2 sensor is based on non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) sensing technology. This methodology utilizes infrared light to detect the presence and measure the concentration of CO2 in the surrounding environment. Alongside, its built-in sensors for temperature and humidity function on the principles of thermistor and capacitive sensing, respectively. 

Installation Guide:
To install this device, find a suitable indoor environment - preferably centrally located and at a height of about 1.2 meters. Mount the device using the screw slots provided or adhesive pads onto the wall or a flat surface. Make sure the device is within the range of your LoRaWAN network. After mounting, activate the device by pulling out the battery insulation tab. The device will automatically start scanning for available networks and transmitting data.

LoRaWAN Details:
The ELSYS - ERS CO2 operates using the LoRaWAN protocol, which supports bidirectional communication, multicast addressing and encryption for secure data transmission. The system operates in multiple global frequency bands (EU868, US915, AU915, KR920, AS923, and IN865), making it adaptable for worldwide deployment. Features like Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) help optimize power consumption and extend battery life.

Power Consumption:
The ELSYS - ERS CO2 sensor is optimized for low power consumption, ensuring long-lasting, maintenance-free use. The device is powered by two 3.6V AA lithium batteries, with a lifespan of up to 10 years, depends on the transmission interval and use cases.  

Use Cases:
This device caters to a range of applications primarily in Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) monitoring. It can be used in residential settings, office environments, schools, and hospitals to maintain optimal CO2 levels to ensure human health and comfort. It also finds its application in the agricultural sector for greenhouse management where CO2 levels play a crucial role in plant growth.

Limitations:
Despite its advantages and versatility, the ELSYS - ERS CO2 sensor does have some limitations. Its performance can be affected under extreme environmental conditions beyond its operative range. Also, sensor accuracy might decrease over time and needs recalibration. Additionally, though it supports long-range transmission, obstacles like buildings or other infrastructures might impact the LoRaWAN signal strength. Lastly, since it is designed for indoor use, its durability and longevity might be limited in harsh outdoor environments.
