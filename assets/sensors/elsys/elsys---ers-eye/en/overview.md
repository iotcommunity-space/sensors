ELSYS - Ers Eye Overview

Working Principles:
The ERS Eye from ELSYS is a state-of-the-art optical detection sensor that uses an infrared (IR) light source and a monolithic silicon photodiode to detect changes in light levels around it. To work, the ERS Eye sends out waves of IR light; when these waves are reflected back by an object in their path, they strike the photodiode, changing the amount of current flowing through it. This change is registered by the device's microcontroller, which interprets it as a change in the sensor's surrounding environment. 

Installation Guide:
To install the ERS Eye, simply mount the device to a surface using the included mounting bracket and screws. Then, connect it to the power source included with the device. Remember to ensure that it is positioned such that the IR light source and photodiode are unobstructed and facing the area you wish to monitor.

LoRaWAN Details:
The ERS Eye is fully compatible with the LoRaWAN protocol, which means it can connect to a network of devices using this low-power wireless communication standard. When set to LoRaWAN mode, the ERS Eye operates in a listen-before-talk mode, meaning it will check for any conflicting transmissions before sending its own. 

Power Consumption:
The power consumption of the ERS Eye is notably low. Designed for long-term, battery-powered usage, power consumption is reduced even further when the device is in standby or sleep mode. The exact battery life will depend on the reporting frequency and the environmental conditions.

Use Cases:
The ERS Eye is versatile in terms of its use cases. It can serve in warehouses to track movement and keep up-to-date inventories, in smart-home solutions for motion detection or light adjustment, or in industries for machine utilization and occupancy detection.

Limitations:
While powerful and flexible, the ERS Eye does have some limitations. Its detecting range is subject to limitation depending on the type and reflectance of the object being detected, and it may also react to environmental changes in light levels, such as those caused by turning on a light or opening a door. Its effective range can also be reduced by obstacles that block the IR light source or the photodiode. Finally, hardware limitations on the number of messages that can be sent daily apply. The maximum number of messages a LoRaWAN device can send per day is restricted by the fair access policy.
