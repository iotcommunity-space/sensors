2. **Site Selection**: Position the device at a location that provides optimal exposure to the parameters being monitored, considering signal strength for LoRaWAN connectivity.

3. **Mounting**: Use the provided mounting brackets or fixtures to secure the sensor in place. Ensure it is stable and oriented correctly to maximize measurement accuracy.

4. **Powering the Device**: Insert the specified batteries, ensuring correct polarity. ELSYS - Elt 2 is designed to operate on low power, but itâ€™s critical to use recommended batteries to ensure long-term performance.

5. **Configuration**: Utilize the ELSYS smartphone app or PC software to configure the sensor settings. This includes setting measurement intervals, data transmission frequency, and customizing any specific thresholds for alerts.

6. **Connectivity Test**: Verify connection to a LoRaWAN network. This may involve checking network join status or data integrity through network provider tools.

7. **Calibration**: If required, perform any necessary calibration using reference measurements to ensure sensor accuracy.

#### LoRaWAN Details

- **Frequency Bands**: The Elt 2 supports various frequency plans, including EU868, US915, AS923, and AU915, enabling global deployment.
  
- **Data Transmission**: The device uses adaptive data rate management to optimize communication and battery life.
  
- **Security**: LoRaWAN ensures data integrity and security through network and application layer encryption.

- **Network Integration**: The Elt 2 can be integrated into private networks or public LoRaWAN networks, making it versatile for different project scopes.

#### Power Consumption

The Elt 2 is designed to operate on a very low power profile. It typically utilizes 3.6V AA lithium batteries, offering a long battery life of up to 10 years under standard reporting intervals and conditions. Power efficiency is achieved through a combination of adaptive data rates and energy-efficient processing.

#### Use Cases
