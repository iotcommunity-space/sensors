## ELSYS - EMS DOOR (ELSYS) SENSOR TECHNICAL OVERVIEW

### Working Principles
The ELSYS - EMS DOOR Sensor is a LoRaWAN-empowered device designed for monitoring and tracking door-opening activities. It operates based on the Hall Effect Theory, where a magnetic field's fluctuation concerning a door event activates the sensor. Upon triggering, it communicates this event by transmitting signals via LoRaWAN. 

### Installation Guide
1. **Positioning the Sensor:** Decide the installation point - make sure it is in a location where door activity is constant, and the sensor is safe from interference.
2. **Mounting:** Mount the sensor using the supplied screws or double-sided tape. The unit includes both magnet part (small one) and sensor part (big one). The magnet part should be attached to the moving part of the door, and the sensor part should be fixed on the door frame.
3. **Pairing the Sensor:** Pair the sensor with your chosen LoRaWAN network by entering it in your LoRaWAN network server, using the device EUI.
4. **Checking connectivity:** After installation, open and close the door to test the sensor's functioning. Check if your LoRaWAN application server is receiving the door opening/closing events.

### LoRaWAN Details
The ELSYS - EMS DOOR Sensor functions on the LoRaWAN protocol, connecting to LoRaWAN gateways within its range. It supports Class A communication, uses adaptive data rate (ADR), and the standard frequencies according to its regional regulations. 

### Power Consumption
The ELSYS - EMS DOOR Sensor has low power consumption, and it is powered by two AA 3.6V Lithium batteries. The battery life spans approximately 10 years, but this depends on the frequency of door open/close events.

### Use Cases
1. **Office Security:** The sensor can be useful in monitoring office spaces to track unauthorized access during off-hours.
2. **Home Safety:** The sensor aids in securing residential buildings by alerting homeowners when doors are opened or closed, potentially intruders.
3. **Warehouse Management:** In a warehouse setting, these sensors can help track activities around high-valued or restricted areas.

### Limitations
1. **Magnetic Interference:** Deployment near other objects releasing strong magnetic fields might interfere with the sensor's performance.
2. **Range Limitation:** The sensor should be within the LoRaWAN gateway's range to transmit signals effectively. 
3. **Network Dependency:** The sensor depends on the availability and stability of the LoRaWAN network.

While the ELSYS - EMS DOOR Sensor demonstrates a reliable and efficient monitoring solution, its successful operation depends on careful consideration of the installation location, monitoring frequency, and suitable network connection.
