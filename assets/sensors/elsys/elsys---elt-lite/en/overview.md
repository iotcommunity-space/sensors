### ELSYS - ELT Lite (ELSYS) : Technical Overview

#### Working Principles
The Elsys (ELT Lite) is a smart IoT device designed to monitor environmental factors like temperature, humidity, and light intensity. The device collects data from its environment using sensors and sends it via the LoRaWAN communication protocol to a network server. The collected data can be used for analytical applications, predictive maintenance, and real-time monitoring. 

#### Installation Guide
The installation of the ELT Lite device is a simple process:

1. Attach the device to your preferred location using built-in mounts. Ensure the device is positioned optimally to collect accurate data.
2. Power up your ELT Lite device.
3. Use the configuration tool provided by ELSYS to customize sensor behaviors and settings.
4. Connect the device to your LoRaWAN network by following your network provider's instructions. The device will start collecting and sending data to your network server.

#### LoRaWAN Details
ELT Lite operates on the LoRaWAN communication protocol, which is a long-range, low-power wireless platform beneficial for IoT networks worldwide. ELT Lite supports adaptive data rate (ADR) and is fully compatible with LoRaWAN 1.0.2. The device operates on various frequencies, which will depend on your geographical region, with options for EU868, US915, AU915, and AS923.

#### Power Consumption
ELT Lite is an energy-efficient device ideal for long-term deployments. Power is supplied through two 3.6V AA lithium batteries, with an operational life expectancy of up to 10 years, although actual longevity will depend on environmental conditions and transmission intervals.

#### Use Cases
1. **Home and Building Automation**: ELT Lite is perfect for monitoring indoor climates and optimizing energy efficiency.
2. **Smart Agriculture**: ELT Lite can be used to monitor temperature, humidity, light levels, etc., helping farmers make informed decisions about irrigation and plant health.
3. **Cold Chain Management**: ELT Lite allows you to monitor temperature and humidity within storage facilities and during transportation, ensuring goods remain within their required conditions.

#### Limitations
While the ELT Lite is an advanced sensor with many applications, there are certain limitations:

1. **Limited Indoor Range**: Depending on building materials and obstacles, LoRaWAN signals may face impediments.
2. **Dependent on LoRaWAN Network**: The device's operation is restricted to areas covered by a LoRaWAN network.
3. **Limited Sensor Range**: The device only measures certain environmental aspects - for more advanced or specific data collection, additional sensors may be required.

In conclusion, the Elsys ELT Lite is an adaptable, long-lasting sensor that's well suited to a wide range of applications across various sectors. Due to its reliance on the LoRaWAN network, careful planning around location and signal strength is necessary to ensure the sensor operates optimally.
