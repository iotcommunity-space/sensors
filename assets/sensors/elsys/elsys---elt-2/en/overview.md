### TECHNICAL OVERVIEW: ELSYS - Elt 2 (ELSYS)

#### General Overview
The Elt 2 by ELSYS is a compact and versatile Internet of Things (IoT) sensor built primarily on the LoRaWAN technology. It caters to an array of sensing facilities like temperature, humidity, light, and motion, effective for environments where various factors need to be monitored.

#### Working Principle
The operation of the Elt 2 starts with the sensors capturing environmental data like temperature, light, and movement. This data is then communicated via Low Range (LoRa) signals to a LoRaWAN gateway. The gateway in turn, transfers this data to a network server which sends it to the chosen application server. The data received by the application server can then be visualized and analyzed.

#### Installation Guide
Installation of the Elt 2 is an uncomplicated process:
1.  Locate a suitable spot to install the sensor in the area where the monitored parameters are most critical.
2.  Secure the sensor in place using adhesive or screws (supplied).
3.  On successful installation, join the sensor to the LoRaWAN network.
4.  Activate the sensor.
5.  Start receiving data on your application server.

The documentation of ELSYS provides a thorough guide with additional steps and troubleshooting tips for the installation process.

#### LoRaWAN Details
The Elt 2 utilizes the LoRaWAN protocol for efficient and reliable communication. This long-range, low-power wireless platform enables secure, bi-directional communication in IoT, M2M, and smart city applications. The Elt 2 supports LoRaWAN specification 1.0.2 and operates in numerous frequency bands, including the EU 868 MHz band and the US 915 MHz band.

#### Power Consumption
Operating on two AA batteries, the Elt 2 is designed to work for up to 10 years (subject to variation, depending on usage and environment factors). Its long battery life can be attributed to the low power consumption of the LoRaWAN protocol and ELSYS's power-optimized hardware and software design.

#### Use Cases
The Elt 2 sensor is versatile and can be deployed in various scenarios. Key uses include:

1.  **Environmental Monitoring**: With sensors to measure temperature, humidity, and light, Elt 2 can ensure ideal conditions in storage areas, greenhouses, or other sensitive locations.
2.  **Intruder Detection**: The equipped motion sensor makes Elt 2 suitable for detecting human presence in monitored zones.
3.  **Asset Management**: By placing Elt 2 on movable assets, their movements can be tracked.

#### Limitations
While the Elt 2 sensor is comprehensive, it does have some limitations:
1.  **Range**: Communication range can be limited by environmental factors such as topography, building construction, etc.
2.  **Accuracy**: While Elt 2 provides a good accuracy across its range of sensing capabilities, it may not match specialized sensors.
3.  **Battery Life**: Factors such as data transmission frequency, distance from the gateway, and environmental conditions can significantly affect battery life.
