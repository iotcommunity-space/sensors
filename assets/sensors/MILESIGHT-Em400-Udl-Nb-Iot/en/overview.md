### Technical Overview: MILESIGHT EM400 UDL NB-IoT

#### Product Overview
The MILESIGHT EM400 UDL NB-IoT is a sophisticated IoT device designed to facilitate remote environmental monitoring by leveraging NB-IoT (NarrowBand Internet of Things) technology. This sensor is adept at transmitting data over long distances while maintaining low power consumption, making it ideal for a variety of applications.

#### Working Principles
The MILESIGHT EM400 UDL operates by integrating multiple sensors within its architecture to measure environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, and pressure. Its core functionality relies on NB-IoT technology, which uses cellular bands to provide extended coverage and deeper penetration in challenging environments such as urban areas and inside buildings.

The device continually collects data at predefined intervals. It processes these data points and communicates them over the NB-IoT network to a remote server or cloud platform, where they can be accessed and analyzed. This process ensures real-time monitoring and allows for timely actions based on the environmental conditions.
