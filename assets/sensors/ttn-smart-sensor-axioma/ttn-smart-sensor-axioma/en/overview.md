# Technical Overview: TTN Smart Sensor (Axioma)

## Introduction

The TTN Smart Sensor (Axioma) is an advanced sensor solution designed for remote monitoring and data collection using the LoRaWAN protocol. It integrates multiple sensor modalities for diverse environmental and industrial applications and is optimized for low-power consumption and long-range communication.

## Working Principles

The TTN Smart Sensor (Axioma) employs LoRaWAN technology to provide long-range, low-power communication capabilities. The sensor utilizes integrated components such as temperature, humidity, and pressure sensors to gather environmental data. This data is transmitted periodically to a LoRaWAN gateway, which then forwards it to a network server for processing and analysis.

Key Features:
- **Multi-sensor Integration**: Combines various sensor types to monitor environmental parameters.
- **LoRaWAN Connectivity**: Enables long-range communication (up to 10 km in rural areas).
- **Low Power Consumption**: Designed to operate for years on battery power.

## Installation Guide

1. **Unboxing and Inspection**:
   - Carefully unbox the TTN Smart Sensor package.
   - Ensure all components are present and undamaged, including the sensor unit, mounting accessories, and installation manual.

2. **Site Selection**:
   - Choose an installation site that ensures a clear line of sight to the LoRaWAN gateway for optimal signal strength.
   - Avoid locations with interfering structures or heavy RF interference.

3. **Mounting the Sensor**:
   - Use the provided mounting brackets to secure the sensor unit on a suitable surface.
   - Position the sensor at an optimal height and angle to accurately capture environmental conditions.

4. **Powering the Sensor**:
   - The sensor is powered by an internal battery. Ensure the battery is fully charged before installation.
   - Verify that the power switch (if applicable) is in the 'ON' position.

5. **Configuration**:
   - Use the TTN console or associated application to configure the sensor settings, such as data transmission intervals and thresholds.
   - Pair the sensor with the nearest gateway by entering the required activation details like DevEUI, AppKey, and AppEUI.

6. **Testing and Calibration**:
   - After installation, perform a test transmission to confirm connectivity with the network server.
   - Calibrate the sensor if necessary to ensure accurate data capture.

## LoRaWAN Details

- **Frequency Bands**: Supports EU868, US915, and other regional bands.
- **Class and Activation**: Operates typically in Class A mode with support for OTAA (Over-The-Air Activation).
- **Data Rate**: Utilizes Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) to optimize signal quality and battery life.
- **Security**: Implements AES-128 encryption for secure data transmission.

## Power Consumption

The TTN Smart Sensor (Axioma) is engineered for low power usage with the following consumption parameters:

- **Idle State**: < 10 ÂµA
- **Active Transmission**: ~30 mA
- **Battery Life**: Up to 5 years, depending on the transmission frequency and environmental conditions.

## Use Cases

- **Environmental Monitoring**: Track temperature, humidity, and air pressure in agriculture, greenhouses, or remote locations.
- **Industrial Applications**: Monitor equipment or facility conditions in manufacturing plants.
- **Smart City Solutions**: Integrate with city infrastructure to monitor weather conditions or air quality.

## Limitations

- **Range Limitations**: Effective range might be reduced in urban environments due to obstructions.
- **Interference**: Performance can be impacted by electromagnetic interference from other devices or large metallic structures.
- **Weather Resistance**: Some models may require additional enclosures or weatherproofing for extreme environments.

Overall, the TTN Smart Sensor (Axioma) is a robust solution well-suited for IoT applications requiring long-range, reliable, and low-power wireless communication. Proper installation and configuration are essential to optimize its performance across various use cases.
