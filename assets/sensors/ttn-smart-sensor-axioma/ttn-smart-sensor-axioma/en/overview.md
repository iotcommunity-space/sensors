**Technical Overview for TTN Smart Sensor (Axioma)**

**1. Working Principles:**
The TTN Smart Sensor (Axioma) is a wireless IoT device designed to perform multiple sensing tasks such as measuring temperature, humidity, accelerometer, pressure, and magnetic reed switch control. The sensor operates on the principle of data acquisition and transmission through LoRaWAN network.

The sensor reads data from its inbuilt sensors, then encodes and transmits the data to a LoRaWAN gateway. This data is then forwarded by the gateway to your selected network server allowing data to be processed and visualized in a user-friendly format. 

**2. Installation Guide:**
The installation process of the TTN Smart Sensor (Axioma) comprises some straightforward steps. Initially, the battery should be inserted into the device. Then, the device should be switched on. The next step is to pair the sensor with the LoRaWAN gateway, which will concentrate signals from the sensor and send them to the network server. Following successful pairing, the device is ready to get attached to the vital area for data collection. 

**3. LoRaWAN Details:**
LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) is essential for the operation of the TTN Smart Sensor. It is a low power, long range, and low bandwidth networking protocol that uses the LoRa modulation scheme for communication. The sensor connects to the LoRaWAN gateway to transmit the sensed data which in turn is sent to the network server. The frequency of operation, data rate, and transmission power is regulated according to the LoRaWAN specification of the region in use. 

**4. Power Consumption:**
TTN Smart Sensor (Axioma) is known for its low power consumption. The sensor operates on a coin cell battery which can last up to several years depending on the frequency of data transmission and the operating environment. 

**5. Use Cases:**
The TTN Smart Sensor can be employed in a wide range of applications, including:
- Environmental monitoring in buildings and offices
- Agricultural monitoring for soil moisture, temperature, and humidity
- Warehouse and cold storage monitoring
- Asset tracking and monitoring in logistics and supply chain
- Predictive maintenance in industrial machinery

**6. Limitations:**
Despite its multiple advantages, the TTN Smart Sensor (Axioma) has a few limitations. Primarily, it has a limited transmission range which is affected by obstacles and the presence of other radio signals. Furthermore, it does not have any self-healing or meshing capabilities. Finally, the sensor's effective operation is dependent on LoRaWAN network coverage. Without a suitable gateway within reach, the sensor will be unable to transmit its data.
