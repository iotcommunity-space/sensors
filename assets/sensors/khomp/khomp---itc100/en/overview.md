# Technical Overview for KHOMP - Itc100 (KHOMP)

## Working Principles
KHOMP - Itc100 is a hardware device that operates based on the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, specifically on LoRaWAN technology. It employs LoRaWAN, a low-power wide-area network protocol, which allows for wireless communications over long distances by sensors and actuators for M2M and IoT applications.

The Itc100 device collects data from multiple sources and transmits it over a network to a central server. This function is achieved by collecting data from the sensors, converting it to an understandable format, and then transferring it over the LoRaWAN network. 

## Installation Guide
1. **Device Placement:** Locate the Itc100 in a suitable place, considering wireless signal strength, power supply accessibility, and physical protection.

2. **Sensor Connection:** Connect your sensors to Itc100. Ensure to follow the sensorâ€™s documentation for appropriate wiring.

3. **Network Connection:** Connect the device to your LoRaWAN network by following the configuration steps in the device manual.

4. **Power-on:** After all connections, power on Itc100.

5. **Configuration:** Configure the device's settings as per your requirements, including LoRaWAN device parameters and sensor data transmission intervals.

## LoRaWAN Details
KHOMP - Itc100 operates on the LoRaWAN protocol, providing secure and efficient communication, minimizing power consumption and facilitating long-range connectivity. The device follows the class A operation, which balances both power efficiency and latency. It supports Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) and possesses inbuilt encryption algorithms following LoRaWAN specifications.

## Power Consumption
KHOMP - Itc100 is designed for low power consumption, supporting different operational modes that let you regulate its power usage. The device is powered with a range of DC 9-48V and typically consumes less than 2W of power in active mode, making it power-efficient.

## Use Cases
