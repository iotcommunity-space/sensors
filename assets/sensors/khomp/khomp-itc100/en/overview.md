# Technical Overview for KHOMP - ITC100

The KHOMP ITC100 is a sophisticated IoT device designed to monitor and transmit temperature and humidity data over long distances using LoRaWAN communication. This device is primarily utilized in smart agriculture, environmental monitoring, and building management systems.

## Working Principles

The ITC100 utilizes a precise sensor that measures temperature and humidity. Once the data is gathered, it uses LoRaWAN, a low-power wide-area networking protocol, to transmit the data to a central server or cloud-based platform for analysis. LoRaWAN allows the ITC100 to send data over several kilometers with minimal power consumption, making it ideal for remote or large-scale deployments.

The ITC100 operates on a pre-defined duty cycle, collecting data at regular intervals and transmitting it based on configured settings, which can be adjusted remotely via the LoRaWAN network to enhance power efficiency or data granularity.

## Installation Guide

1. **Location Selection**:
   - Choose a location that is within the coverage area of a LoRaWAN gateway.
   - Ensure the installation site is free from obstructions such as large buildings or dense vegetation that could block the signal.

2. **Mounting**:
   - Secure the ITC100 to a stable surface using the included mounting bracket.
   - Position the device with the sensor element pointing downwards to minimize the impact of direct sunlight, precipitation, or debris.

3. **Power Source**:
   - The ITC100 is typically powered by long-lasting lithium batteries. Install the batteries by accessing the battery compartment and ensuring correct polarity.
   - Optionally, connect to a dedicated power source if available.

4. **Configuration**:
   - Use the manufacturer's tool for configuration over USB or a compatible Bluetooth connection.
   - Input the device EUI, application keys, and network settings as needed for LoRaWAN connection.

5. **Testing**:
   - Once installed, verify the device functionality by checking the initial transmission data in the network server's console.
   - Confirm signal quality and data accuracy.

## LoRaWAN Details

The ITC100 is fully compatible with global LoRaWAN standards and typically operates on the 868 MHz (Europe) or 915 MHz (USA) ISM bands. It supports:

- **Adaptive Data Rate (ADR)**: Adjusts the data transmission rate to optimize network performance and battery life.
- **OTAA and ABP**: Supports both Over-The-Air Activation (OTAA) and Activation By Personalization (ABP) to join LoRaWAN networks.
- **Class A Device**: Operates predominantly in a low power mode, with available windows for downlink messages after each uplink transmission.

## Power Consumption

The ITC100 is designed for ultra-low-power operation, essential for battery-operated devices in remote or challenging environments. With an average power consumption of a few microamperes in sleep mode and milliamperes during transmission, the device can operate on a single set of batteries for several years depending on transmission frequency and environmental conditions.

## Use Cases

- **Smart Agriculture**: Monitor microclimate conditions within agricultural fields to optimize irrigation and crop health.
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Track weather conditions in real-time for environmental studies and disaster management.
- **Building Management**: Integrated into HVAC systems to enhance climate control and energy efficiency.
- **Industrial Applications**: Used in warehouses or production sites to maintain ambient conditions for sensitive goods.

## Limitations

- **Signal Obstruction**: Physical obstructions such as dense buildings or topographical features can impede signal transmission efficiency.
- **Fixed Calibration**: The unit requires periodical calibration checks to maintain sensor accuracy, which could be a limitation in extremely sensitive applications.
- **Reliance on LoRaWAN Network**: Functionality is dependent on the availability and infrastructure of the LoRaWAN network, which may not be available in exceedingly remote areas without gateway installations.
- **Environmental Exposure**: While the device is robust, extreme environmental conditions beyond its rated specifications may impact longevity and performance.

In summary, the KHOMP ITC100 is a reliable and efficient IoT device for temperature and humidity monitoring, leveraging LoRaWAN technology for extended range communication with minimal power consumption. Its practical design and configuration options make it suitable for a variety of applications, while its limitations should be considered in deployment planning.
