Overview:
The KHOMP IoT Sensor 402 - also referenced as the ITS 402 - is a cutting-edge device that is designed to monitor and report a range of environmental parameters including temperature, humidity, and light. It makes use of the Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) technology following the LoRaWAN protocol. The primary function of the sensor is to gather data, make sense of it, and send it to a LoRaWAN based gateway for effective and efficient analysis. 

Working Principles:
The KHOMP ITS 402 implements its operations using LoRaWAN technology, an open-source communication protocol designed for data transfer over long ranges using low power. It uses a unidirectional communication method, collecting data from the environment and transmitting this information to a gateway for further processing. As a smart device, the KHOMP ITS 402 uses sophisticated technologies like adaptive data rate (ADR) to optimize communication efficiency between the sensor and the gateway. 

Installation Guide:
Carefully insert the two AA batteries into the device, paying attention to the polarity. Then, attach the device to your desired location using the adhesive provided or by screwing it into place. Now, configure it either OTA (Over-The-Air) or by using a GUI platform on your PC. The sensor will now start to assess environmental factors and transmit the data to your chosen cloud platform through a connected gateway.

LoRaWAN Details:
This sensor works on the LoRaWAN 1.0.2 specification class A devices, which optimizes power usage and extends battery life. It communicates over the EU863-870, US902-928, AU915-928, and AS923 frequency bands and supports ADR capabilities. The sensor encrypts data using the AES128 encryption method, ensuring safe data transmission.

Power Consumption:
KHOMP ITS 402 is a low power consumption device and uses only two AA 1.5V batteries with a life expectancy of up to 2 years, depending on the environmental conditions and the reporting frequency.

Use Cases:
The KHOMP ITS 402 is ideal for many applications in which understanding environmental conditions is necessary, such as smart homes, agricultural monitoring, meteorological stations, and industrial control systems.

Limitations:
Though KHOMP ITS 402 is an effective tool for monitoring environmental factors, it does have its limitations. The device only operates within a certain temperature range (-10 to +50 degrees Celsius). Also, while designed for use in a wide range of environmental conditions, it is not waterproof and cannot operate underwater or in highly humid conditions. In addition, because it uses LoRaWAN technology, its performance is affected by the presence and reliability of LoRaWAN networks in the area of operation.
