## Technical Overview: TEKTELIC Cold Room IoT Sensor

### Introduction
The TEKTELIC Cold Room sensor is a specialized IoT device designed for monitoring the environmental conditions within cold storage facilities. It ensures that temperature-sensitive products such as food, pharmaceuticals, and chemicals are stored under optimal conditions by providing real-time data on temperature, humidity, and other environmental factors.

### Working Principles
The TEKTELIC Cold Room sensor operates by continuously monitoring ambient temperature and humidity levels within a cold room environment. The sensor incorporates advanced sensing technologies to ensure accurate and reliable data collection. It leverages integrated digital sensors to detect changes in temperature and humidity and transmits this data wirelessly over a Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) using the LoRaWAN protocol.

### Installation Guide
1. **Location Selection:**  
   - Install the sensor in a location that accurately represents the average conditions of the space.
   - Avoid placing the sensor near doors, vents, or other areas prone to rapid temperature changes.

2. **Mounting the Sensor:**  
   - Utilize the provided mounting brackets or adhesive pads to secure the sensor to a wall or ceiling.
   - Ensure that the sensor is mounted at a height that prevents contact with products or fluids.

3. **Initial Configuration:**  
   - Install the batteries ensuring they are oriented correctly.
   - Power on the device, which will automatically enter joining mode to connect to a LoRaWAN network.

4. **Network Joining:**  
   - Verify that a LoRaWAN gateway is within range and operational.
   - Upon start-up, the sensor will attempt to join the network using Over-The-Air Activation (OTAA).
   - Confirm successful network joining via an acknowledgment message from the network server.

5. **Calibration and Testing:**  
   - Once installed, allow the sensor to stabilize and calibrate based on initial readings.
   - Compare with calibrated instruments to ensure accuracy.

### LoRaWAN Details
- **Frequency Bands:** Supports multiple global ISM bands such as EU868, US915, AS923.
- **Security:** Uses AES-128 encryption for data payloads to ensure secure data transmission.
- **Communication:** Sends data at regular intervals defined during setup, commonly every 15 minutes.
- **Network Keys:** Utilizes both Network Session Key (NwkSKey) and Application Session Key (AppSKey) for secure, encrypted communication.

### Power Consumption
- The TEKTELIC Cold Room sensor is designed for ultra-low power operation.
- Powered by a standard battery, typically a high-capacity lithium lifecycle lasting up to 10 years, depending on configuration and usage.
- Power-saving features include periodic wake-up for sensor reading and data transmission, ensuring long battery life.

### Use Cases
- **Food Storage:** Monitoring temperatures in meat lockers and dairy storage rooms to prevent spoilage.
- **Pharmaceuticals:** Ensuring vaccines and medicines are stored at regulated temperatures to maintain efficacy.
- **Chemical Storage:** Monitoring humidity levels to prevent corrosion or degradation of materials sensitive to moisture.
- **Frost Prevention:** Timely detection of dropping temperatures in agricultural storehouses to activate heating systems.

### Limitations
- **Range Limitations:** Communication range may be affected by physical obstructions such as thick walls or metal structures.
- **Environmental Constraints:** Extreme temperatures outside the rated range may affect sensor accuracy.
- **Network Dependency:** Requires the presence of a LoRaWAN network for data transmission; isolated locations may need additional infrastructure.
- **Calibration Drift:** Requires periodic calibration checks to maintain accuracy over extended use, especially in volatile environments.

In summary, the TEKTELIC Cold Room sensor offers reliable and efficient monitoring for temperature-sensitive environments, though considerations around network coverage and installation conditions must be addressed to ensure optimal performance.
