**DECENTLAB - DL 5Tm Sensor Technical Documentation**

1. **Overview**
 The DECENTLAB - Dl 5Tm is a high-end IoT-based sensor designed by Switzerland based company, DecentLab. This IoT device is engineered to measure soil moisture and soil temperature. The main workhorse of this system is the Time-Domain Transmission (TDT) sensing principle, which enables the sensor to capture accurate measures on soil conditions.

2. **Working Principle**
The sensor operates using the TDT principle where an electromagnetic signal travels along a waveguide probe that is situated in the soil. Shifts in the soil's dielectric constant - which is directly related to soil moisture content - alters the speed of the electromagnetic wave along the probe. By measuring this speed, the DECENTLAB - Dl 5Tm calculates the volumetric water content (VWC). For soil temperature calculations, the sensor has an integrated temperature sensor.

3. **Installation Guide**
     1. First, mount the DL 5Tm device on a suitable place where it can penetrate into the soil.
     2. Connect the antenna to the sensor and ensure that it's upright for good signal reception.
     3. Set up the LoRaWAN  network access with the provided credentials and connect it to the sensor.
     4. Lastly, insert the batteries into the sensor and switch on the power to start the setup.

4. **LoRaWAN Details**
DL 5Tm uses Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN), a type of communication technology facilitating low power, wide-range communication between IoT devices and their respective gateways. It operates in multiple global bands and can be compatible with public and private networks. It ensures secure bi-directional communication, mobility and localization services.

5. **Power Consumption**
The sensor is designed for low power consumption to extend battery life, making it ideal for field deployments. The active mode averages around 150 mA while the idle mode power consumption is less than 3 mA. Proper power management can give the sensor a battery life of a few years.

6. **Use Cases**
Applications of the DL 5Tm range from agriculture, precision farming, golf courses, parks to environmental research projects. It assists in monitoring soil conditions and allows users to take action based on accurate soil data, leading to effective water use, prevention of over-watering and under-watering, thus improving plant health and yield.

7. **Limitations**
   1. Interference: The device may experience interference caused by surrounding structures and objects, affecting the LoRaWAN's signal strength.
   2. Soil Incompatibility: In highly saline or sandy soils, measurement accuracy could be compromised.
   3. Maintenance: Regular maintenance and battery replacement are essential to make sure the device maintains its performance over time.

Lastly, it's important to note that the configuration setup may vary as per unique scenarios and it is recommended to refer to the manufacturer's manual for complete instructions and guidelines.
