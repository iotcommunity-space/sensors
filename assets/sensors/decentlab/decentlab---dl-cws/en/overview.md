## DECENTLAB - DL CWS

### Overview

DECENTLAB - DL CWS is a high-precision IoT sensor designed by Decentlab. Its primary function is to measure ultrasonic distance, temperature, and humidity. The sensor employs LORA technology for remote data transmission and delivers an impressive performance, making it suitable for widespread use in various industrial and environmental applications. 

### Working Principles

The DECENTLAB - DL CWS working principles are based on ultrasonic sound waves detection. It emits these waves, which bounce back after hitting a target object. The sensor then measures the time it takes for the waves to return, thereby determining the distance to the object. In terms of temperature and humidity, the sensor uses a built-in digital-controlled capacitance sensor that collects temperature and humidity data based on variant electrical capacity.

### Installation Guide

For an optimal functioning of DL CWS, it is advised to install the sensor upright in the open field avoiding any physical obstacles. Before the installation, the pre-defined sensor configuration needs to be set through a LORA Gateway or the Decentlab Data Access Platform. Connect the antenna to the SMA connector and turn on the sensor by moving the ON/OFF switch.

### LoRaWAN Details

The DECENTLAB - DL CWS is compatible with the LoRaWAN protocol, which is a low power, wide area networking protocol designed to wirelessly connect battery operated ‘things’ to the internet. It operates on the basis of open standards, unlike other LPWAN IoT technologies.

The sensor is pre-configured before delivery to automatically transmit data to the defined LORA gateway or to the Decentlab platform. This sensor operates in several frequency bands including the EU433, CN470, EU868, US915, AU915, and AS923 to cater to different regional requirements.

### Power Consumption

The power consumption of the DECENTLAB - DL CWS is impressively low given its functionality. It is equipped with a 3.6V AA Lithium-Thionyl chloride (Li-SOCl₂) non-rechargeable battery which has a 10-year maximum lifespan, ensuring less frequent battery replacements.

### Use Cases

This versatile sensor finds application in a broad range of uses. It can be used in building automation for monitoring room or building occupancy or smart agriculture to detect and monitor crop growth. Other notable use cases include parking space management, waste container monitoring, measuring water levels in reservoirs, and snow or foliage detection.

### Limitations

The DECENTLAB - DL CWS limitations are few but noteworthy. Firstly, its accuracy may be affected if the target object is not perpendicular to the sensor. Also, even though it is designed to handle tough environmental conditions, extremely adverse climatic conditions like fog, steam, or heavy rain may cause inaccuracies. Lastly, like most wireless devices, signal strength can be a limiting factor; transmission may be disrupted with extensive distances or dense physical hurdles between the sensor and the LORA Gateway.
