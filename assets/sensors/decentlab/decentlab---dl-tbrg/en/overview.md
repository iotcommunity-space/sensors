## Technical Overview of DECENTLAB - DL TBRG (DECENTLAB)

### Working Principles

The DECENTLAB - DL TBRG sensor, also known as Decentlab Tipping Bucket Rain Gauge is designed for precise rainfall tracking and monitoring. This IoT device is a high-precision sensor that calculates the quantity of rainfall by counting each 'tip' occurring due to the weight of water, hence the name – tipping bucket rain gauge. The sensor does not measure the volume of rainfall but rather the number of tips, which equates to a designated amount of rainfall. The accumulated tips are then translated into millimeters or inches of rainfall via software and transmitted via the LoRaWAN protocol.

### Installation Guide

Installing DECENTLAB - DL TBRG is streamlined for convenience, involving the following steps:

1. **Locating position**: Select an open area away from buildings and trees to avoid wind turbulence. Also maintain a suitable distance from Radio Frequency (RF) noise generating sources to ensure efficient communication with the network.

2. **Securing pole wire**: Use outdoor rated U-bolts, clamps or brackets to affix the sensor on a pole. The device's square shape makes it easy to install.

3. **Leveling**: Use a spirit level to ensure the device is level. The design of the sensor includes adjustable leveling feet to help attain accurate position.

4. **Connecting transmission wire**: Route the transmission wire inside the conduit provided. Connect the wires according to the corresponding color codes.

### LoRaWAN Details

The DECENTLAB - DL TBRG is a LoRaWAN Class A device, ideal for low power, wide area network applications. It operates on the 868 MHz EU or 915 MHz NA frequency, providing bi-directional communication options. Its communication capabilities are contextual upon both the network server and the LoRa application server.

### Power Consumption 

Consumption stands at 89 µA in sleep mode, about 24 mA during transmission, and approximately 54mA while in full operation. It is thus suited for battery operation over extended periods.

### Use Cases

The DECENTLAB - DL TBRG demonstrates broad utility in several sectors. These include:

1. **Meteorology and Hydrology**: Real-time data regarding rainfall helps meteorologists predict weather patterns and hydrologists study water management.

2. **Agriculture**: Rainfall data facilitates informed decision-making regarding irrigation and overall crop management.

3. **Environmental Monitoring**: Tracking rainfall supports assessments of climate variation and risk management related to droughts and floods.

### Limitations

While the DECENTLAB - DL TBRG sensor is a powerful tool, it does present limitations:

1. **Interference With RF Noise**: Proximity to other RF devices can cause communication issues.

2. **Physical Blockage**: Fallen leaves or other debris within the tipping bucket could lead to inaccurate rainfall measurements.

3. **Storage Limit**: The sensor does not store the rainfall data itself, requiring regular data transmission to avoid data loss.



Please note that DECENTLAB - DL TBRG requires ongoing maintenance and periodic emptying and cleaning of the tipping bucket to ensure accurate results. This involves observing standard safety protocols to prevent damage to delicate parts. Check with local regulations and guidelines for any additional installation requirements.
