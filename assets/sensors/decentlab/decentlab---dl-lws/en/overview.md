## DECENTLAB - Dl Lws Technical Documentation

# I. Overview

The DECENTLAB - DL LWS is a LoRaWAN-capable sensor equipment designed to monitor water and other liquid levels accurately in various settings. The device employs a radar sensor operating on the time-of-flight principle to determine liquid levels with high precision.

# II. Working Principles

The DECENTLAB DL LWS Radar Level Sensor uses time-of-flight technology by emitting a signal that gets reflected back from the surface of the liquid being measured. The device measures the time taken by this signal to make a return trip and uses the data to calculate the distance. An inbuilt temperature sensor adjusts the time-of-flight with respect to the ambient temperature to ensure accurate readings.

# III. Installation Guide

The DECENTLAB DL LWS should be securely mounted vertically above the liquid surface to be measured. The radar sensor module should face directly downward toward the liquid. Ensure that there are no obstacles within the direct detection range. The device is equipped with a 1/2" NPT male threaded fitting or an M30 x 1.5 male threaded fitting for installation. Also, due to its IP67 protection, it can be used outdoors and in harsh environments.

# IV. LoRaWAN Details

As a LoRaWAN device, the DL LWS Radar Level Sensor supports long-range communications up to approximately 15 kilometers line of sight. It operates on the ISM band and complies with the LoRaWAN 1.0.2 specifications. It supports Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) and can be configured to work with any LoRaWAN network.

# V. Power Consumption

The DECENTLAB DL LWS operates on a 3.6V AA lithium battery. Under typical conditions and with a measurement interval of 15 minutes, this battery should last at least two years. However, battery life could be lesser depending on the quality of battery used or under excessive temperatures.

# VI. Use Cases

The DECENTLAB DL LWS Radar Level Sensor can be used in various scenarios, such as monitoring water levels in reservoirs, wastewater management, tank level measurement in chemical plants, flood level monitoring, and irrigation control in agricultural settings.

# VII. Limitations

Its effectiveness hinges on the calibration of the sensor and direct range to the liquid surface. Therefore, it may not function optimally in environments with extreme temperature changes, additional acoustic or electromagnetic interference, or when the liquid surface is excessively foamy or agitated. It is also limited by the line of sight distance of LoRaWAN communications. Additionally, as it operates on batteries, regular replacement is necessary for continuous operation.
