## DECENTLAB - CO2 Sensor Technical Documentation

### 1. Overview

The DECENTLAB CO2 Sensor is a cutting-edge device designed specifically for measurement of Carbon Dioxide gas (CO2). It benefits from the latest in Internet of Things (IoT) technology, providing efficient and accurate readings over large areas. Utilizing LoRaWAN technology for data transmission, it ensures easy installation, low power consumption, and wide-ranging accessibility.

### 2. Working Principle

The DECENTLAB CO2 Sensor operates based on the Nondispersive Infrared (NDIR) sensor principle. NDIR sensors are simple spectroscopic devices designed to measure the concentration of a gas in a mixture. CO2 absorbs infrared radiation at a specific wavelength and the amount of absorbed radiation is related to the concentration of CO2 in the gas. The sensor uses this principle to determine the amount of CO2 present in its environment.

### 3. Installation Guide

The sensor should be installed in a clear space where aerosols, dust, and humidity can't affect its performance. To install the sensor follow the steps below:

1. Connect the sensor to the power source (battery or external power source).
2. Associate the device with your LoRaWAN network by entering its unique Device EUI.
3. Position the sensor in the desired monitoring location. Ensure the sensor's fields of measurement are not obstructed.
4. Test the data transmission to your LoRaWAN gateway to ensure optimal connectivity.

### 4. LoRaWAN Details

The sensor communicates using the LoRaWAN protocol, a low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) specification. It's designed for wireless battery-operated Things in a regional, national or global network. This technology ensures a long-range communication with the sensor and low power consumption.

### 5. Power Consumption

The DECENTLAB CO2 Sensor is designed for long-term, continuous operation with minimal power utilization. It uses LoRaWAN, which is a low-power communication protocol allowing the sensor to operate for an extended period on a single battery charge, often for several years, reducing the overall operational costs and maintenance frequency.

### 6. Usage Cases

DECENTLAB CO2 Sensor is widely used in both indoor and outdoor applications. Indoor usage includes air quality monitoring, HVAC systems optimization, and monitoring CO2 levels in schools, offices or factories. Outdoor use cases often involve monitoring CO2 levels in urban areas, farming fields for smart agriculture or monitoring natural resources.

### 7. Limitations

While the DECENTLAB CO2 Sensor is designed for robust performance, certain environmental conditions may affect its operation. These include:

- High levels of dust or aerosols can affect the sensor's ability to accurately measure CO2 levels.
- Extreme humidity or rapid changes in humidity can affect sensor performance.
- Operation in extremely cold or hot temperatures may impact device functionality.
- Physical obstructions may limit the range and effectiveness of LoRaWAN connectivity.

By understanding these limitations, users can install and operate their DECENTLAB CO2 Sensor to ensure peak performance and accurate readings.
