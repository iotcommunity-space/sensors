## TECHNICAL OVERVIEW: DECENTLAB - DL NTU

### Working Principles:
The DECENTLAB - DL NTU is a multi-parameter water quality sensor, designed to precisely measure different chemical properties of water. The sensor is capable of measuring parameters such as turbidity, dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature, conductivity, oxidation-reduction potential, and many more.

The NTU sensor operates on the principle of Nephelometry. It measures the scattering effect of suspended particles, i.e., the amount of light scattered at a 90Â° angle from the incident beam in NTU (Nephelometric Turbidity Units).

### Installation Guide:
To install the DECENTLAB - DL NTU sensor:

1. Attach the sensor to its designated attachment point.
2. Connect the cables according to the color-code guide in the manual.
3. Configure the sensor settings in your IoT platform to suit your data measurement needs.
4. Test the sensor system once it is installed to ensure correct transmissions.

### LoRaWAN Details:
The DECENTLAB - DL NTU sensor is equipped with a LoRaWAN Class A interface for wireless communication. This Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) protocol allows long-range communication with low power consumption, making it ideal for IoT applications.

LoRaWAN also supports encryption for secure data transfer, flexible deployment options, and bi-directional communication, ensuring both device-to-network and network-to-device messaging.

### Power Consumption:
The DECENTLAB - DL NTU sensor is designed with low power consumption in mind. Its operation voltage is typically between 3.3V and 5.5V. The average current in sleep mode is typically less than 0.1 mA. This makes the sensor ideal for battery-operated and energy-harvesting applications.

### Use Cases:
The DECENTLAB - DL NTU sensor finds extensive use in various sectors such as:

1. Aquaculture: Monitoring of water quality in fish tanks and ponds.
2. Industrial Effluent Monitoring: Tracking of chemical properties of water to ensure compliance with discharge standards.
3. Water Treatment: Analysis of water before and after treatment to assess effectiveness.
4. Environmental Monitoring: Studying the health of rivers, lakes, and other water bodies.

### Limitations:
While the DECENTLAB - DL NTU is a reliable and comprehensive device, there are certain limitations to note:

1. Calibration: The sensor needs regular calibration to maintain its accuracy.
2. Temperature Dependencies: Some parameters, like dissolved oxygen, are temperature sensitive, which may necessitate additional considerations during data interpretation.
3. Susceptibility to Fouling: Like all water quality sensors, the DL NTU sensor may be vulnerable to bio-fouling, which can affect the accuracy of readings over time.
4. Range Limitation: Although the sensor's LoRaWAN protocol allows long-range communication, physical barriers or harsh weather conditions may impact the signal quality.

Overall, understanding these limitations can help users employ the DECENTLAB - DL NTU sensor effectively to achieve optimal results.
