**Technical Overview for DECENTLAB - Dl CT10 (DECENTLAB)**

**Working Principles**
The DECENTLAB - Dl CT10 is a sensor designed primarily for measuring conductivity, temperature and depth in water bodies. The sensor uses three separate technologies. The conductivity measurement is performed through an inductive non-contact method that prevents corrosion and fouling. The thermistor within the sensor takes accurate temperature readings, while a piezoresistive pressure sensor measures the water depth accurately based on fluid pressure changes.

**Installation**
Installing the DL-CT10 sensor involves a few key steps. First, position and secure the sensor in the desired monitoring location - it should be fully immersed in the water body. Connect the sensor to the data transmitter using the provided cable which has connectors on both ends. Ensure that cable connectors are firmly tightened. The sensor will then transmit data to the paired DECENTLAB Data Logger via the provided cable. Please, remember to follow local regulations and guidelines for installations.

**LoRaWAN Details**
The DECENTLAB - DL-CT10 sensor employs the LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) technology for communication, which allows the sensor to transmit information over a long range while maintaining low power consumption. This sensor operates in LoRaWAN 1.0.3 and supports most frequency bands in this range. Specific frequency and power parameters can be adjusted to best fit local regulations and needs.

**Power Consumption**
The DECENTLAB - DL-CT10 sensor demonstrates low power consumption characteristics. It operates on an external power supply of 3.6V to 24V. The standby current is less than 0.15uA, and the maximum measurable current is 20 mA. These specifics make it suitable for applications where long term, unreplenished power source is a requirement.

**Use Cases**
The DL-CT10 sensor by DECENTLAB finds applications mainly in environmental monitoring and research projects where conductivity, temperature, and depth are vital metrics. This includes tracking water temperature for fisheries, monitoring seawater for salt intrusion and contamination, tracking water levels in catchment areas during rainfall and climate studies, etc.

**Limitations**
While the DL-CT10 sensor offers a wide range of features and capabilities, there are a few limitations. The sensor is designed to be submersible but has a depth limitation of 10 meters. Prolonged exposure beyond this depth could lead to damaged components or inaccurate measurements. The sensor performs optimally in clear water conditions, and heavy sediment or debris might affect the accuracy of readings. Lastly, even though the sensor makes use of the LoRaWAN network, signal transmission may still be affected by geographical or man-made obstacles. 

Please, always follow the operating instructions and maintenance guidelines provided by DECENTLAB to ensure proper operation and longevity of the sensor.
