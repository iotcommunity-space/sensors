## DECENTLAB – Dl Pyr (DECENTLAB) Sensor Technical Overview

### 1. Working Principles 

The DECENTLAB - Dl Pyr sensor is a high-quality, precision differential pyranometer designed for global solar radiation measurement. It operates based on the principle of thermopile. The thermopile absorbs the incoming radiation, producing a temperature difference proportional to the radiation. This temperature difference gives rise to an electromotive force (EMF), which is then converted into a digital signal for data processing.

### 2. Installation Guide 

To install the Dl Pyr properly, follow these steps:

- Select an installation location with direct, unobstructed sunlight exposure.
- Align the sensor correctly towards the celestial equator.
- Secure the sensor to the base mount and fasten tightly.
- Connect the sensor to the DECENTLAB - Data Logger with the provided cable. 

Please refer to the specific installation manual for detailed steps and precautions. 

### 3. LoRaWAN Details 

The DECENTLAB - Dl Pyr comes with a built-in long-range interface LoRaWAN, which is a low-power-wide-area network (LPWAN) protocol designed for wirelessly connecting devices with low-bandwidth connectivity. The sensor will periodically send data via this network to a pre-configured IoT platform. It supports LoRaWAN Class A, B, and C and operates in the frequency range of 868 MHz (EU) or 915 MHz (US).

### 4. Power Consumption 

The Dl Pyr sensor is powered by a built-in 3.6V AA Lithium battery, offering low power consumption with a lifespan of up to 5 years. The sensor also has an operational voltage range of 3.4 V – 6.5 V. 

### 5. Use Cases 

DECENTLAB - Dl Pyr sensors are particularly useful in meteorology, climate studies, photovoltaic systems, and building automation systems. They provide essential data for understanding and optimizing illumination and solar energy distribution. 

### 6. Limitations 

Like any sensor technology, the DECENTLAB - Dl Pyr has limitations:

- Measure precision can degrade under extreme weather conditions, like heavy rain or snowfall.
- The sensor requires a clear line of sight to the sky; any obstruction to sunlight can affect measurement accuracy.
- Power consumption could increase due to frequent transmission or poor network connectivity.
- The sensor operates within a certain temperature range, and exceeding this can impact its performance.

Regular calibration and maintenance can help address these limitations and ensure the sensor's continuous and accurate operation.
