**DECENTLAB - DL PHEHT OVERVIEW**

The DL-Pheht by Decentlab is a cutting-edge IoT sensor designed for precision-based monitoring of soil pH and soil water potential in near real-time. Benefiting from the latest sensing technology, LoRaWan's long-range wireless technology, and built-in sustainable power sources, the DL-Pheht ensures efficient data monitoring and collection in diverse environmental settings.

**1. Working Principles**

The DL-Pheht works based on advanced sensor technology. For pH detection, it uses ion-selective field effect transistors (ISFET) technology with a reference electrode for precise measurements. The water potential is measured using a peltier-cooled dew point mirror. The sensor measures the dew point temperature and uses it to calculate the water potential. 

**2. Installation Guide**

1. Site selection: Consider a spot that is representative of the zone you want to monitor.
2. Mount the DL-Pheht sensor at a proper height above the ground, ensuring that the antenna is not obstructed by metal or concrete surfaces.
3. Connect the sensor probe to the respective port of the DL-Pheht device.
4. Turn on the device. The LED will flash briefly, indicating the device is in setup mode.
5. Use the Decentlab Configuration Tool to configure the device to your network and application parameters.
6. Once setup, the device will begin transmitting data to the assigned network, ready for monitoring.

**3. LoRaWAN** 

The DL-Pheht leverages the power of LoRaWAN (Low Range Wide Area Network) for the transfer of data. LoRaWAN is a popular IoT communication protocol favoring long-range communication with low power consumption, making it ideal for IoT applications. 

**4. Power Consumption**

DL-Pheht is designed with a low-power architecture and features an energy-harvesting solar panel. When fully charged, its internal battery allows it to operate continuously for up to 10 years without requiring replacement, depending on the data transmission rate. 

**5. Use Cases**

The DL-Pheht has a broad range of applications including: 
- Agricultural production: Optimizing irrigation and nutrient management.
- Environmental monitoring: Monitoring pH and water potential in wetlands, forests, and other ecosystems.
- Research: Potentially, any applications requiring soil pH and soil water potential data collection.

**6. Limitations**

Despite its advanced functionalities, the DL-Pheht has some limitations:
- Direct sunlight, rainfall, and high winds may affect the sensor readings.
- It requires a LoRaWAN gateway within range for data transmission.
- Sensor readings may lose precision in highly saline soils.
- The device operates in specific temperature and humidity ranges, beyond which the performance may be affected.

The DECENTLAB - DL Pheht affords tremendous flexibility and provides a wealth of data in collaborative IoT environments, which can be a critical element in making intelligent, accurate, and efficient decisions based on soil pH and water potential parameters.
