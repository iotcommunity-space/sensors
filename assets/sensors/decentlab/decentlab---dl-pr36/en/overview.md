## DECENTLAB - DL PR36 Overview

DECENTLAB's DL PR36 is a high-performance IoT sensor designed specifically for industrial monitoring applications. DL PR36 utilizes cutting-edge IoT technologies to deliver highly accurate, reliable, and consistent data in real time.

### Working Principles

The DL PR36 operates on the principles of gas diffusion and selective absorption, with a well-calibrated amperometric gas sensor. This sensor can accurately identify unique gas signatures and deliver precise readings. It integrates a precision temperature, pressure, humidity, and gas sensor for holistic scenario analysis.

### Installation Guide

Installation of the sensor is a simple two-step process. Firstly, carefully insert the device in proximity to the area of monitoring. Make sure the sensors are not blocked or obstructed. Secondly, connect the sensor to the network gateway either via the LoRaWAN or by any local network following the instructions provided on the installation guide. On successful connection, the device is ready and can start data transmission.

### LoRaWAN Details

DECENTLAB - DL PR36 uses LoRaWAN (Low Range Wide Area Network) technology, a type of wireless telecommunication wide area network designed to allow long-range communications at a low rate among connected devices. It offers high capacity for handling millions of messages per base station, thereby providing excellent connectivity even in hard-to-reach areas.

#### Power Consumption

The sensor is designed for low power consumption to ensure longevity and reliability. The operating power ranges from 0.5 to 10 mW, depending on the configuration and the complexity of the tasks. The device operates on a low power mode when not in use to save energy.

### Use Cases

The DL PR36 sensor has its applications in a plethora of industries including agriculture, manufacturing, environmental monitoring, smart buildings, and climate control. It plays an integral role in monitoring air quality, detecting gas leaks, predicting weather changes, and controlling HVAC systems.

### Limitations

While the DL PR36 offers numerous features and advantages, there are limitations to be aware of. As the device is highly sensitive, exposure to corrosive or reactive gases might impair its functionality. Furthermore, the device reliance on the LoRaWAN Network for communication might be a limiting factor in areas with weak or no network presence. Lastly, the sensor works effectively in a temperature range between - 20°C and 50°C and might experience performance issues beyond this.

In summary, the DECENTLAB - DL PR36 is a comprehensive IoT sensor solution offering robust performance within various industrial conditions. However, its correct installation, understanding of operation, and maintenance can impact the full realization of its features and limits.
