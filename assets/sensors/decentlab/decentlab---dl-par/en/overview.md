## DECENLAB - DL PAR Overview

### Working Principle

DECENTLAB's DL PAR is a state-of-the-art PAR (Photosynthetically Active Radiation) sensor designed for discrete, reliable, and ongoing plant health and growth monitoring. It measures the light in the photosynthetically active range of the light spectrum (400-700 nanometers) which most plants utilize for photosynthesis. Analysis of this specific light intensity is critical in determining plant health, potentially influencing future growth trends, and yield prognosis in managed environments.

The DL PAR sensor operates using a photodiode that reacts to incoming light in the PAR frequency, generating a voltage response which is mechanically translated into a precise light intensity reading.

### Installation

DL PAR sensor installation involves three main steps: physical setup, network connectivity, and software interface/commissioning. 

Physical setup refers to the sensor's strategic positioning to achieve the most accurate PAR data. This is usually within the plant canopy or just above to measure incident light.

For network connectivity, the sensor can be directly connected to the LoRaWAN low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) designed for wireless battery-operated devices. This permits real-time data collection and transmission to the designated server.

The software interface allows for data interpretation. Here, the user will finalize the commissioning process, and designate settings like data log intervals, data analysis parameters, relevant environmental control decisions, among others. 

### LoRaWAN Details

As a LoRaWAN enabled device, the DL PAR sensor can communicate over long ranges while consuming low power. It operates on the unlicensed ISM band with energy-efficient data transmission up to 10 km urban or 40 km rural coverage.

The DL PAR is designed to work with LoRaWAN protocol version 1.0.2, operating on the EU863-870 and US902-928 frequency bands, adaptable to the local regulation by selecting the appropriate LoRaWAN band.

### Power Consumption

The DL PAR sensor is energy efficient, offering a battery life spanning over 10 years when set to a data transmission interval of 15 minutes. The actual battery life may vary based on the configured reporting interval and environmental factors.

### Use Cases

The main application of the DL PAR sensor is in precision agriculture where constant monitoring of PAR light can inform growing strategies to enhance plant efficiency and productivity. It's also used in weather stations as a data source to help understand how light influences climate. In research settings, it offers invaluable insights into studying plant physiology, supporting bio-sciences, viticulture, and horticulture.

### Limitations

While the DL PAR sensor is a vital tool, it has a few limitations. Firstly, it is sensitive to dust, dirt, or any object that can obscure the sensor's face, leading to erroneous readings. Routine maintenance is required to ensure accurate operation. 

Moreover, while LoRaWAN offers long-range connectivity, its performance can be impacted by environmental factors such as physical obstructions or radio interference. 

Lastly, it's crucial to position the PAR sensor correctly, as incorrect installation angles or shading from surrounding structures could affect the sensor readings.
