## DECENTLAB - DL OPTOD Technical Overview 
---

The DECENTLAB DL OPTOD is a versatile sensor system designed for superior data acquisition from optical dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature and pressure sensors. The system is capable of handling a wide range of environmental conditions, from complete immersion in water to exposure to varying degrees of moisture, dust, and temperature.

### Working Principles

This system operates based on state-of-the-art optical fluorescent lifetime quenching principle. The optode (a sensor that uses an optical measurement technique) tips of the sensor hold a special sensing foil that is excited by either a blue or red LED. An optical sensor then measures the time delay (phase shift) between LED excitation and the returned light signal. This phase shift is directly related to dissolved oxygen concentration. The DL OPTOD is optimized for precision even under varying temperature and pressure conditions.

### Installation Guide 

1. Identify a suitable location - preferably with good LoRaWAN network coverage.

2. The DL OPTOD should be securely mounted to provide stability and prevent movement caused by winds or other external factors. Make sure that the sensor is in an upright position for accurate data collection.

3. Connect the sensor to the device following the provided cable diagrams in the manual, ensuring all connections are secure.

4. The device should be configured appropriately through the LoRaWAN network before deployment.

### LoRaWAN Details

The DECENTLAB DL OPTOD sensor uses the LoRaWAN protocol (Class A device) for data transmission. The system operates on any of the global LoRaWAN bands from CN470 to AS923. It offers selectable data rates and adjustable transmission power, customized through downlink commands.

### Power Consumption

The DL OPTOD is designed with energy efficiency as a priority. It operates on a single 3.6V AA lithium battery and can achieve up to 10 years of autonomous operation depending on the settings and environmental conditions.

### Use Cases

The DL OPTOD sensor is ideal for applications such as:

   * Aquaculture: Monitoring oxygen levels in fish tanks and ponds.
   * Environmental studies: Observing DO levels in rivers, lakes, or oceans and aiding in water quality research.
   * Wastewater treatment: Ensuring the dissolved oxygen level necessary for microbial digestion of organic waste is maintained.

### Limitations

Although the DL OPTOD offers superior performance in a wide range of applications, there can be some limitations. Its performance might be affected in environments with high turbidity or in the presence of strong dyes. Also, since it relies on LoRaWAN for data transmission, its functionality might be limited in areas with poor LoRaWAN network coverage. Lastly, while the battery life can last up to 10 years depending on the specific usage and environmental factors, the device does not have an option for external power sources.
