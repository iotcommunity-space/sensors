## Technical Overview â€“ DECENTLAB - Dl Pr36Ctd (DECENTLAB)

### Introduction
DECENTLAB - DL PR36CTD device is a state-of-the-art IoT sensor developed to deliver reliable, high-quality monitoring of Pressure, Temperature, and Conductivity (PTC). Its key features include high durability, precision, and long battery life, suitable for an array of environmental and industrial applications.

### Working Principles
DECENTLAB - DL PR36CTD deploys a highly sensitive sensor system - a combination of a pressure sensor, a temperature sensor, and a conductivity sensor. The pressure sensor monitors changes in atmospheric or water pressure, the temperature sensor picks up variations in temperature, and the conductivity sensor measures the ability of a material to conduct electricity. The sensor's readings are sent to a connected LoRaWAN device, which then forwards the data to the assigned network.

### LoRaWAN Details
DECENTLAB - DL PR36CTD leverages Low Power Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) connectivity to deliver long-range, low-power wireless qualities. It supports the LoRaWAN protocol Class A and Class C and is compatible with LoRaWAN 1.0.2 and 1.1. The frequency bands deployed depend on the regional regulations and can have a transmission range of up to 15 km in rural areas and 5 km in urban areas.

### Installation Guide
For the installation process, you need to:

1. Install the LoRaWAN gateway in an appropriate location.
2. Configure the sensor with the DECENTLAB - DL PR36CTD software.
3. Connect the sensor to the LoRaWAN gateway.
4. Assign sensors to the correct dashboard on the network.
5. Perform initial tests to ensure proper communication between the sensors and the network.

Detailed instructions should be followed from the product manual for a successful installation.

### Power Consumption
The DECENTLAB - DL PR36CTD is a low-power device engineered to preserve battery life. It operates on a small 3.6V lithium battery, with intelligent power management functions that allow the sensor to sleep between measurements. This aids significantly in prolonging the battery life, which can last for up to 10 years, depending on the data transmission interval and environmental conditions.

### Use Cases
The DECENTLAB - DL PR36CTD device is particularly useful in diverse sectors due to its versatile measurement capabilities. Some of its wide-ranging use cases include circumstances requiring the monitoring of water quality in rivers, dams, or oceans, the tracking of soil moisture for agricultural purposes, and overseeing industrial processes involved in the production of food, chemicals, or pharmaceuticals.

### Limitations
While the DECENTLAB - DL PR36CTD is a robust and versatile sensor, it does have certain limitations. Its performance can vary depending on the external environment. Additionally, the sensor does not function optimally in extreme conditions such as high temperatures or high conductivity levels. Given that the device operates on a battery, the longevity and efficiency of the device may decrease as the battery gets depleted. Furthermore, the wireless range can be influenced by obstacles, structures, or terrain that interfere with signal transmission.

Overall, the DECENTLAB - DL PR36CTD device presents a significant contribution to IoT monitoring solutions, enabling reliable performance and accurate data collection across a myriad of sectors.
