**DECENTLAB - Dl Pr21 Technical Overview:**

**Working Principles:**
The DECENTLAB - Dl Pr21, hereafter referred to as the DL Pr21, is designed to measure a wide range of parameters including pressure, temperature, and humidity. It operates using Piezoresistive Pressure Sensing technology which offers extremely accurate, high resolution measurements. This design allows it to operate within harsh environmental conditions without compromising the accuracy of readings.

**Installation Guide:**
Installation of the DL Pr21 is typically straightforward. The sensor comes with a mounting plate for easy deployment. It should be installed in a location where it is protected from the elements, but still exposed to the medium you are monitoring (water, air, oil). 

1. Secure the mounting plate to a flat surface using the enclosed screws.
2. Connect to the sensor using the enclosed cable. 
3. Position the sensor on the mounting plate and secure it.
4. Connect the sensor to your LoRaWAN network following the instructions specific to your network.

**LoRaWAN details:**
DL Pr21 is compatible with the LoRaWAN wireless communication standard. It operates in the 868 MHz or 915 MHz frequency, as per regional regulations. The transmitted data contains all necessary information from the sensor including temperature, humidity, and pressure values. The data is encrypted for safe transfer over public networks.

**Power Consumption:**
The DL Pr21 is designed to be economical in terms of power consumption. The sensor is powered by a battery which can be recharged via solar power. In normal operating conditions, the battery can last up to two years, depending on the frequency of measurements performed.

**Use Cases:**
The DL Pr21 is extremely versatile and can be employed in multiple environments, such as:

- Monitoring the environmental conditions in precision agriculture
- Industrial applications, tracking moisture or pressure in manufacturing environments
- Performing measurements within scientific studies or research
- Monitoring weather conditions in meteorological studies

**Limitations:**

While the DL Pr21 is a highly robust and versatile sensor, it does have a few limitations:

- It must be installed within the range of a LoRaWAN network to ensure continuous data transmission.
- Physical/environmental barriers can obstruct the sensorâ€™s communication with the network which in turn, may affect data transmission.
- The sensor is ideally suited for protected outdoor use or indoor use. Excessive exposure to harsh elements may impact its lifespan and performance.
- Humidity range is between 0-100%RH. Outside this range, accuracy cannot be guaranteed.
- The sensor does not perform well in salty air or saline water conditions.

Remember to account for these factors and your specific needs when planning the installation of your DL Pr21 sensor.
