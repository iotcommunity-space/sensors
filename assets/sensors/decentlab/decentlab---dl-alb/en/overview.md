## **DECENTLAB - Dl Alb (DECENTLAB): Technical Overview**

### **Working Principles**
The DECENTLAB - Dl Alb is an advanced ambient light and barometric pressure sensor, designed to capture, process and transmit ambient light intensity and barometric pressure data. It works on a photodiode principle where it senses and converts light into electrical signal and a barometric sensor that measures the weight of the column of air above it. It integrates these results for the calculation of absolute and temperature-adjusted barometric pressure.

### **Installation Guide**
The installation of the DECENTLAB - Dl Alb is a straightforward process. First, it should be mounted in a location with clear exposure to ambient light and minimal interference from changes in local pressure. The sensor is connected to a DECENTLAB LoRaWAN bridge for data transmission, which is then connected to a LoRaWAN gateway. The steps are as follows:

1. Mount the DECENTLAB - Dl Alb device using the brackets included in the package. Ensure the clear part of the sensor is unobstructed.
2.  Connect the sensor to a DECENTLAB LoRaWAN bridge using the provided cable, ensuring tight and secure connections.
3.  Set up your DECENTLAB LoRaWAN gateway and register it with your network server.
4.  Connect the LoRaWAN bridge to the gateway and set up and register your DECENTLAB - Dl Alb sensor in your LoRaWAN network server using the provided device EUI and App Key.
5.  Once set up, check the network server for incoming data to verify the sensor is functioning correctly.


### **LoRaWAN Details**
The DECENTLAB - Dl Alb sensor utilizes the LoRaWAN low-power, wide-area network protocol for data transmission. This standard is optimized for extensive range, low power usage, and excellent penetration of physical barriers. The sensor supports the LoRaWAN 1.0 and 1.0.2 standards and operates in the EU868, US915, AU915, and AS923 frequency bands, making it suitable for use in many parts of the world.

### **Power Consumption**
The DECENTLAB - Dl Alb is designed for efficient power usage to maximize the lifespan of its onboard power source. The sensor uses a low-power microcontroller and a LoRaWAN class A protocol with adaptive data rate, reducing power consumption while maintaining robust and reliable data transmission capabilities. Depending on the frequency of data transmission, the sensor can operate for several years on a single set of batteries.

### **Use Cases**
The DECENTLAB - Dl Alb sensor is designed for a wide variety of applications. It is ideal for use in weather stations, environmental monitoring networks, building automation, and agriculture. In addition, it can be used for predictive maintenance in pressure-sensitive environments like manufacturing facilities and laboratories, and in solar energy systems for monitoring and optimizing light-based energy production.

### **Limitations**
Whilst the DECENTLAB - Dl Alb sensor is well-suited for a wide range of applications, like any piece of technology, it does have limitations. Its data transmission range can be influenced by dense urban landscapes and thick walls, as well as interference from other wireless devices operating in the same frequency bands. It is not designed for submerged or excessively humid environments, and it may struggle at the extreme upper and lower ends of its operational temperature range.
