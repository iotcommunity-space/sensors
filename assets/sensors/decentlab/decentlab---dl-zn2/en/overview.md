### TECHNICAL OVERVIEW: DECENTLAB - Dl Zn2 

## Working Principles 
The DECENTLAB - Dl Zn2 is an IoT enabled device designed to support reliable and accurate measurements of zinc ion concentration in aqueous solutions. It works based on ion-selective electrode method, an analytical technique utilized in chemistry for measuring ion concentrations in the aqueous phase. The device also leverages temperature compensation, which optimises the accuracy of results across a wide range of environmental conditions.

## Installation Guide
To install the DECENTLAB - Dl Zn2 sensor, follow the steps below:

1. Connect the sensor to the power source until itâ€™s ready-to-install.
2. Fix the sensor vertically, ensuring it's immersed in the solution for taking measurements.
3. Connect the sensor with the LoRaWAN network by setting the right frequency and your network's credentials on the sensor using the provided user-interface.
4. Once the device is linked to the LoRaWAN network, evaluation of zinc concentration can commence.

For a successful installation, ensure that the sensor is at a location where it can communicate efficiently with the LoRaWAN gateway.

## LoRaWAN Details
The DECENTLAB - Dl Zn2 uses the LoRaWAN technology for connectivity, operating on standard LoRaWAN frequency. This provides long range, low power wireless platform that is the prevailing technology choice for building IoT networks worldwide.

## Power Consumption 
The device is optimized for low power consumption which is an excellent feature for remote installations where power resources can be scarce. The sensor uses a battery for its operation which can last for years dependent on the frequency of measurements taken.

## Use Cases 
Several applications of DECENTLAB - Dl Zn2 include:

- In Agriculture, it can help monitor the level of zinc in soil to maintain the fertility of the soil.
- It can be used by wastewater treatment plants to keep an eye on dissolved zinc levels
- It is relevant in industries and factories where zinc is used in the manufacturing process to monitor levels of zinc in their effluents.

## Limitations 
Despite the sensor's high level of precision and usability, there are few limitations:

- It requires calibration periodically to ensure accuracy of the results.
- It can only measure zinc ion concentration in aqueous solutions and not in any other phase.
- Disturbing the sensor during its reading might lead to inaccurate results.

In conclusion, the DECENTLAB - Dl Zn2 sensor is a groundbreaking device in the IoT field, providing accurate and reliable results for zinc ion concentrations. With its efficient power consumption and integration within the LoRaWAN network, it serves as a great tool especially in monitoring environmental conditions.
