# DECENTLAB - DL BLG Overview

## Overview
DECENTLAB- DL BLG is a highly advanced Internet of Things (IoT) device, specifically designed for the needs of modern wireless communication systems. It operates on the fundamental principles of the LoRaWAN technology, serving a wide range of applications including pressure measurement in liquids and gases, as well as in various other fields like the environment monitoring, IoT-based infrastructure, and logistics.

## Working Principle
The DECENTLAB - DL BLG device works based on the principle of LoRaWAN, a Low-Power, Wide-Area-Network (LPWAN) protocol for communication. LoRaWAN enables low-power devices to connect to a network over long distances, broadening IoT device connectivity. The device measures pressure through a highly precise, temperature-compensated, piezo-resistive sensor.

## Installation Guide
1. As per the requirement of the application, mount the DL BLG sensor in the desired location.
2. Connect the sensor with the power source or insert the required batteries.
3. Establish a connection with the LoRaWAN network by configuring the Network Session Key, Application Session Key, and the Device Address.
4. Validate the connection by observing the data on the LoRaWAN network server.

## LoRaWAN Details
The DECENTLAB - DL BLG works on LoRaWAN protocol version 1.0.3. It is a Class-A device that offers access to multiple LoRaWAN data rates varying from DR0 (SF12, 250 Bits/Second) to DR5 (SF7, 5500 Bits/Second).

## Power Consumption
The device is characterized by low power consumption, consuming only about 25 ÂµA in the idle state and around 38 mA during transmission, taking into consideration the highest data rate.

## Use Cases
The DECENTLAB - DL BLG is commonly used in numerous industrial applications. It is essential for accurate and reliable digital barometric pressure measurement in weather forecasting stations, aviation industries, as well as for metering in gas and water utilities. It serves in environmental monitoring, smart agriculture, and smart cities that incorporate IoT-based infrastructures.

## Limitations
1. The device requires a LoRaWAN network for operation, which is not available everywhere.
2. The transmission range might be affected by physical obstacles and the surrounding environment.
3. The power consumption during data transmission is quite high, which might require frequent battery replacements in the absence of an external power source.

Even with these limitations, the DECENTLAB DL BLG device is a staple in wireless communication systems, leveraging the low-power and wide-range capabilities of the LoRaWAN technology.
