Technical Overview of SENSATIVE - Multi Sensor +Drip

1. Working Principles

SENSATIVE Multi Sensor +Drip is a highly sophisticated IoT device that operates based on certain principles of technology. It integrates various types of sensors to monitor and report crucial data concerning environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, luminosity, motion, leak detection, and more. 

The Strip is designed so that the sensors can communicate the received information to a central gateway via LoRaWAN (Low Range Wide Area Network). The sensed data collected is then either stored or further processed, based on the design of the IoT system architecture. 

The primary features, such as leak detection, work on the principles of pressure change. When a leak is detected, the device triggers an alarm, and the information is instantly reported to the network utilizing LoRaWAN technology. 

2. Installation Guide

Installing the SENSATIVE Multi Sensor +Drip device involves a few critical steps:
- Choose the most suitable location for the sensor, ideally where you anticipate water leakage or wish to monitor environmental conditions.
- Clean the area where you want to mount the sensor. The device comes with a self-adhesive back, making it easy to install.
- Pair the device with the LoRaWAN gateway before sticking it to the desired location. Follow the manual for guidance on how to connect your sensor to the gateway.

3. LoRaWAN Details

LoRaWAN (Low Range Wide Area Network) is a digital communication protocol designed for long-range communications with low power consumption. It's optimized for devices that require infrequent data exchange, rendering it ideal for battery-operated IoT gadgets.

SENSATIVE Multi Sensor +Drip utilizes LoRaWAN for its communication, operating in various frequency bands (868 MHz EU/ 915 MHz US), thereby ensuring global compatibility. It complies with LoRaWAN 1.0.3 and 1.1.x Class A and Class C.

4. Power Consumption

SENSATIVE Multi Sensor +Drip is developed to be highly energy efficient. It's powered by a replaceable 3.6V Li-ion battery, offering durability and longevity. The device has built-in power management capabilities that guarantee a battery life of up to 10 years, depending on the reporting interval and environmental conditions.

5. Use Cases

The SENSATIVE Multi Sensor +Drip is used in various scenarios, including:
- Monitoring environmental conditions in industrial environments for process optimization.
- Early detection of water leaks in proprietorsâ€™ homes, condos, and other property types to mitigate damage.
- Assuring optimal conditions in agriculture by providing crucial data about temperature, humidity, and light.
- Surveillance in commercial and domestic settings using motion sensors.

6. Limitations

Despite its capabilities, the SENSATIVE Multi Sensor +Drip has some limitations. For instance, its sensor's effectiveness may be disrupted by extreme environmental conditions. Although it is designed to be waterproof, extended extreme conditions might impact the device's performance. 

Communication may be limited in areas with poor network connectivity or when installed at long distances from the LoRa gateway. Besides, the performance of the sensor can be impacted by the battery's life, which, although long-lasting, can be diminished by heavy usage or harsh environmental conditions.
