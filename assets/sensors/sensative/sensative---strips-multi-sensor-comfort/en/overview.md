SENSATIVE - Strips Multi Sensor +Comfort (SENSATIVE)

**Technical Overview**

SENSATIVE's Strips Multi Sensor and Comfort is an intelligent Internet of Things (IoT) device designed to monitor a wide array of environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, and light, ensuring indoor comfort and stability in your building or home. 

**Working Principles**
The sensor works based on the principles of data collection, transmission, and interpretation. It employs tiny, high sensitivity detectors in measuring temperature, humidity, and light with extreme precision. The collected data is then digitally transformed and transmitted to a gateway via the LoRaWAN network, which can then be accessed and analyzed through a connected software platform.

**Installation guide**
The Strips Multi Sensor +Comfort is designed for easy installation. Follow the steps below:
1. Charge the device: Strip the device's tab to activate and charge it.
2. Pair with Gateway: Pair the device to your LoRaWAN gateway or network server through the network's standard Join Procedure.
3. Position the sensor: Using the adhesive tape on the back, stick the sensor at the desired location ensuring a clear line of sight for accurate light readings.
4. Configure and test: Complete the setup by configuring the device on your network server and test to verify it's functioning correctly.

**LoRaWAN Details**
LoRaWAN is utilized by the Strip sensor for communication. LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) is best suited for IoT applications thanks to its low power consumption, long-range capability, and secure data transmission. This sensor operates on LoRaWAN protocol 1.0.1 and supports Class A type devices.

**Power Consumption**
The Strips Multi Sensor +Comfort employs a highly optimized sensor design that enables it to have an exceptional battery life of up to 10 years. The device's power consumption is exceptionally low, making it ideal for long-term deployment without needing frequent battery replacements or recharging. 

**Use Cases**
1. Home automation: It allows homeowners to automate and monitor home heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems for comfort and efficiency.
2. Agricultural applications: Monitor indoor farm conditions such as greenhouses to ensure optimum growth conditions for plants.
3. Industrial monitoring: In industries where environment conditions are critical, the sensor can be used to continuously monitor and alert in case of any parameter deviations.

**Limitations**
1. The sensor is designed for indoor use, therefore, might not perform optimally in harsh outdoor conditions.
2. The sensor is dependent on LoRaWAN connectivity, meaning its functionality will be limited in areas with weak or no LoRaWAN coverage.
3. The adhesive used to fix the sensor might lose its stickiness over time thus positioning might be an issue.
4. The battery is non-replaceable. Once drained out, a new device must be purchased.

Despite these limitations, the Strips Multi Sensor +Comfort by Sensative remains a reliable, accurate, and efficient choice for a wide variety of indoor monitoring applications. Its ease of installation, long battery life, and ability to interface with LoRaWAN make it a versatile tool for any IoT-based environmental monitoring setup.
