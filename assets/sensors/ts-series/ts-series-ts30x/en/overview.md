## Technical Overview of Ts Series - Ts30X

The Ts Series - Ts30X is a state-of-the-art sensor designed for environmental monitoring using LoRaWAN technology. It is engineered for accuracy, durability, and long-range communication, making it ideal for various IoT applications.

### Working Principles

The Ts30X operates using a combination of sensors designed to measure environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, and barometric pressure. These sensors convert physical quantities into electrical signals. The sensor data is then processed by a microcontroller unit (MCU) integrated within the Ts30X, which formats the data for transmission. The device uses LoRaWAN communication protocol to transmit these signals over long distances to a central gateway, enabling remote monitoring.

### Installation Guide

1. **Pre-Installation Requirements:**
   - Ensure you have a compatible LoRaWAN gateway.
   - Verify that the installation site is within the LoRaWAN network coverage.
   - Prepare tools for mounting, e.g., screws, brackets.

2. **Physical Installation:**
   - Choose an optimal location: Mount the Ts30X in an open area to ensure maximum signal strength. Avoid placing it near large metal objects or inside metal enclosures that may obstruct the LoRa signal.
   - Mounting: The Ts30X can be pole-mounted or wall-mounted using the provided brackets, ensuring it is secured at a height that minimizes environmental interference and maximizes exposure to the elements being monitored.

3. **Power Connection:**
   - Insert the replaceable lithium battery as per the polarity markings in the battery compartment.
   - Ensure that the power switch is in the 'ON' position.

4. **Network Configuration:**
   - Use a compatible network server to register the Ts30X by inputting its unique DevEUI, AppEUI, and AppKey details.
   - Configure send intervals and data payload settings according to application needs.
