# ELSYS - EMS Sensor: Technical Overview

The ELSYS EMS sensor is designed for measuring environmental parameters with high precision, leveraging the LoRaWAN protocol for seamless connectivity in IoT ecosystems. This document provides a comprehensive overview of the ELSYS EMS sensor, its working principles, installation procedures, LoRaWAN specifics, power consumption details, typical use cases, and known limitations.

## Working Principles

The ELSYS EMS sensor is designed to monitor temperature, humidity, and light intensity. It integrates digital sensors to capture:

- **Temperature:** Utilizes a digital temperature sensor capable of measuring from -40°C to +60°C with precision.
- **Humidity:** Employs a digital capacitive humidity sensor offering reliable performance in a range from 0% to 100% RH.
- **Light:** Uses a photodiode-based sensor to measure ambient light intensity.

These sensors work together to provide a comprehensive environment monitoring solution. The readings are processed internally and transmitted via low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) technology using the LoRaWAN protocol.

## Installation Guide

### Pre-installation Requirements
1. **LoRaWAN Network:** Ensure that a compatible LoRaWAN network is available in the deployment area.
2. **Account Setup:** Set up a user account on a LoRaWAN network server to register and manage the device.

### Physical Installation
1. **Location:** Select a location with minimal obstructions and within signal reach of a LoRaWAN gateway.
2. **Mounting:** Use screws or adhesive pads to mount the sensor. The device should be mounted vertically to ensure proper functioning of the sensors.
3. **Environment:** Avoid exposure to direct rainfall or continuous exposure to direct sunlight, which might affect temperature readings.

### Configuration
1. **Activation:** The EMS sensor typically supports both OTAA (Over the Air Activation) and ABP (Activation by Personalization) for network joining. Configure the device for your network.
2. **Network Parameters:** Ensure the device's DevEUI, AppEUI, and AppKey are correctly configured.
3. **Calibration:** Check if the sensor needs calibration via the manufacturer’s instructions.

### Power-on
Flip the power switch or insert batteries (2 x AAA, 1.5V), and the device should automatically start up and begin data transmission following successful network joining.

## LoRaWAN Details

- **Frequency Bands:** Supports multiple frequency bands (depending on the region), including EU868, US915, AS923, and AU915.
- **Data Rate:** Adjustable data rates complying with LoRaWAN specifications, facilitating optimal balance between range and power consumption.
- **Coverage:** Depending on the environment, LoRaWAN can offer kilometer-range coverage, ideal for remote monitoring applications.
- **Security:** Offers end-to-end encryption for data integrity and security over network communications.

## Power Consumption

- **Battery Life:** The ELSYS EMS sensor is optimized for low power consumption, supporting up to 10 years of battery life under typical use (based on transmission frequency and environmental conditions).
- **Sleep Mode:** Incorporates deep sleep mode to minimize power usage when the sensor is not actively transmitting.

## Use Cases

The ELSYS EMS sensor is versatile and can be used in various sectors, including:

- **Smart Buildings:** For monitoring indoor environmental conditions to enhance energy efficiency and comfort.
- **Agriculture:** Useful for monitoring conditions in greenhouses or storage areas.
- **Warehouses:** Helps ensure optimal environmental conditions for storage of sensitive goods.
- **Museums or Archives:** Preserves materials sensitive to temperature and humidity fluctuations.

## Limitations

- **Environmental Conditions:** Extreme conditions outside the specified operating ranges may lead to reduced accuracy or device malfunction.
- **Signal Obstructions:** Physical barriers and interference can affect LoRaWAN signal strength and range.
- **Calibration Necessity:** Periodic recalibration may be required for sensor accuracy, especially in high humidity or dust-prone areas.
- **Limited Measurement Parameters:** Restriction to temperature, humidity, and light without additional environmental readings, such as CO2, VOCs, etc.

Overall, the ELSYS EMS is an efficient and practical environmental monitoring solution with a broad array of applications, leveraging the robustness of LoRaWAN connectivity while maintaining low operational costs.
