#### Introduction
The FRACTUM Datalogger SL 01 is a robust, efficient sensor designed to capture and transmit environmental and structural data using LoRaWAN technology. This device is ideally suited for applications requiring long-range data transmission with minimal energy consumption, making it perfect for remote monitoring in various industries.

#### Working Principles
The FRACTUM SL 01 utilizes advanced sensing components to measure and record a variety of parameters. This datalogger is engineered to interface with multiple sensors to collect data, including temperature, humidity, pressure, and vibration. The captured data is stored locally and transmitted at specified intervals over a LoRaWAN network to a centralized server, where it can be accessed and analyzed. The device operates on low-power radio technologies, ensuring long battery life and reliable data transmission even in challenging environments.

#### Installation Guide
1. **Site Selection**: Choose a suitable location for the installation, ensuring the area is free from obstructions that could interfere with signal transmission. 

2. **Mounting the Device**: Use appropriate mounting fixtures to secure the datalogger. Ensure the unit is mounted at a recommended height to optimize signal strength and data accuracy.

3. **Sensor Connections**: Connect any external sensors to the FRACTUM SL 01's ports. Verify connections are secure and well insulated.

4. **Power Up**: Insert batteries or connect to a suitable power source. The device is designed for minimal power consumption; however, ensure the power supply meets the operational specifications.

5. **Configuration**: Use the accompanying software to configure device settings, including data logging intervals and LoRaWAN parameters. Ensure proper configuration of network credentials to join the desired LoRaWAN network.

6. **Testing**: Conduct a preliminary test to verify data transmission and network connectivity. Adjust settings as needed based on test results.
