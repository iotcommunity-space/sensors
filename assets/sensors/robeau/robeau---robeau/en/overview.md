## ROBEAU Sensor Documentation

### Overview
The ROBEAU sensor is a cutting-edge unit designed to facilitate the measurement of water flow or fluid velocity within a given system. Developed with IoT and smart technology at its core, ROBEAU offers accurate flow, pressure, and temperature measurements using the LoRaWAN network. Furthermore, it provides real-time data regarding fluid dynamics, making it an ideal choice for remote monitoring, predictive maintenance applications, and comprehensive water management.

### Working Principles
ROBEAU operates on the principle of magnetic flow metering. This involves sending a magnetic field into the targeted fluid. Conductor charges within the fluid will quickly react to this magnetic field, causing them to create a voltage. This generated voltage is directly proportional to the fluid's velocity, enabling ROBEAU to accurately monitor the water flow or fluid velocity.

### Installation guide
1. First, locate an appropriate point of installation where the sensor can be safely attached without causing any disturbances in the fluid flow.
2. Gently fix the ROBEAU sensor on to the chosen point. Ensure to tightly secure the equipment to prevent any leakage.
3. Connect the sensor to a LoRaWAN gateway ensuring a proper and stable LoRaWAN network connection.
4. Lastly, configure and calibrate your ROBEAU sensor to suit your specific needs using the ROBEAU app.

### LoRaWAN Details
ROBEAU utilizes a low-power, wide-area network (LPWAN) protocol called LoRaWAN, designed to wirelessly connect battery operated devices to the Internet. The advantage of LoRaWAN includes deep penetration in dense urban and indoor regions, along with the capability to provide connectivity to IoT devices in rural areas. With this, it creates an optimal platform for long-range communication with low power consumption.

### Power Consumption
ROBEAU sensors are energy-efficient, designed to support long-term operations with minimal power. The sensor operates on a 3.6 V Lithium battery which can run up to 10 years, making it an ideal choice for remote locations with limited access to power resources.

### Use Cases
ROBEAU sensors are particularly useful in real-time remote water usage monitoring in smart cities, industries, and farming for irrigation where they help to manage water usage efficiently. Furthermore, they find application in water treatment plants and wastewater management systems for monitoring and controlling the water flow.

### Limitations
Despite its advantages, the ROBEAU sensor has some limitations. These include:
1. Dependence on Network: The sensorâ€™s performance largely depends on LoRaWAN network availability. In regions with poor LoRaWAN coverage, its performance may be hampered.
2. Not Suitable for All Fluids: The sensor is most accurately used with water or fluids with a similar consistency. It is less reliable when used with thicker or more viscous fluids.
3. Calibration: The sensor needs regular calibration to maintain the accuracy of measurement.

In conclusion, the ROBEAU sensor offers a simple, robust, and convenient solution to remotely monitor and manage water flows with minimal human intervention. Its long battery life, coupled with low power consumption, equips it with sustainable functionality, making it highly beneficial for various industrial sectors.
