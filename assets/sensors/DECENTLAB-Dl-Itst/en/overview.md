### Technical Overview for DECENTLAB - DL-ITST

The DECENTLAB DL-ITST is an advanced IoT sensor designed for measuring and transmitting road surface temperatures, primarily for weather monitoring and maintenance applications. The device utilizes wireless LoRaWAN communication to provide long-range data transmission while ensuring low power consumption, making it ideal for remote deployments.

#### Working Principles

The DL-ITST employs highly sensitive infrared thermopile sensors to measure the surface temperature of roads. It uses a non-contact method by detecting the infrared radiation emitted from the surface. The device converts the infrared energy into a temperature reading through its internal processing capabilities and transmits this data wirelessly via LoRaWAN.

The internal architecture consists of the following components:
- **Infrared Thermopile Sensor**: Detects the emitted IR radiation from surfaces.
- **Internal Processing Unit**: Converts raw sensor data into meaningful temperature readings.
- **Wireless Module**: Implements the LoRaWAN protocol for data transmission.
- **Power Management System**: Enhances battery efficiency and device longevity.

#### Installation Guide

1. **Site Selection**: Choose a location with a clear line of sight to the road surface. The installation area should be free of obstructions that might interrupt the sensor’s line of sight.

2. **Mounting Height**: Install the sensor at a recommended height as specified in the user manual (typically between 1 to 3 meters above the surface). This ensures optimal measurement accuracy by maintaining a consistent field of view.

3. **Orientation and Alignment**: Ensure that the sensor’s axis is perpendicular to the road surface to accurately capture the infrared emissions. Misalignment can lead to erroneous temperature readings.

4. **Secure Installation**: Use the provided brackets and fasteners to secure the device firmly. Vibration and physical disturbances can affect data accuracy.

5. **Power Activation**: Insert the battery pack or connect to the appropriate power source. Ensure connections are secure to avoid power interruptions.

6. **LoRaWAN Network Configuration**: Program the device with the network’s specific configuration parameters (e.g., device address, network session key) using an Over-the-Air Activation (OTAA) or Activation by Personalization (ABP).

#### LoRaWAN Details

- **Frequency Bands**: Operates on ISM frequency bands, such as EU868, US915, and others depending on regional regulations.
- **Class Type**: Typically configured as Class A for minimal energy usage.
- **Adaptive Data Rate (ADR)**: Supports ADR to optimize data rate and transmission power, improving battery life and network capacity.
- **Data Payload**: Contains temperature readings and status information, encoded for efficient transmission.

#### Power Consumption

The DL-ITST is designed for low power consumption, depending on transmission intervals and environmental conditions. It utilizes a battery that can sustain operations for several years under optimal conditions, thanks to:
- Low-power sensor technology.
- Efficient power management systems.
- Wake-on-demand activation only during measurement or transmission tasks.

#### Use Cases

- **Road Maintenance**: Assists in predicting road icing conditions, enabling timely interventions.
- **Weather Stations**: Complements meteorological stations with real-time surface temperature data.
- **Smart City Infrastructure**: Integrates with urban monitoring systems to improve road safety and management.
- **Airport Runways**: Used to measure tarmac temperatures for safety and scheduling operations.

#### Limitations

- **Line of Sight Requirement**: Requires a clear view of the road surface, potentially limiting deployment versatility.
- **Environmental Interference**: Heavy rainfall, snow, or physical obstructions can affect measurement accuracy.
- **Network Coverage**: Relies on LoRaWAN network availability; in areas with poor coverage, data transmission might be compromised.
- **Temperature Range**: Limited to the operational specifications of the thermopile sensor, meaning extreme temperatures might exceed sensing capabilities.

Understanding these aspects of the DECENTLAB DL-ITST will facilitate its effective deployment and use across various temperature monitoring applications.
