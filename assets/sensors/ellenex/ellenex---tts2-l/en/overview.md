# ELLENEX - Tts2 L Technical Overview

## Introduction:
ELLENEX - Tts2 L is a reliable sensor designed to measure temperature and pressure profiling for industrial usage. It is built with robust materials to work seamlessly in harsh environments. This wireless, industrial-grade IoT sensor utilizes the LoRaWAN protocol for communication.

## Working Principles:
The sensor primarily consists of an advanced temperature and pressure sensing module. The controller circuit interprets the input from this module and converts it into digital signals. These signals are then transmitted using LoRaWAN protocol to the connected devices.

## Installation Guide:
1. **Physical Installation**: Mount the sensor at the desired location using attached mounting brackets. Make sure the sensor is positioned in such a way that minimizes the exposure to environmental disturbances.
2. **Device Pairing**: Power on the device, then push the pairing button until the LED blinks. On your network server, you will need to add a new device and enter the provided device EUI and app key.
3. **Settings Configuration**: Set up transmission intervals, data rates, and other parameters based on your requirements through the server interface.

## LoRaWAN Details:
The ELLENEX - Tts2 L operates on the LoRaWAN 1.0.2 protocol, which ensures secure and long-range communication. This feature significantly reduces power usage and enhances its battery life, which can be beneficial for remote and hard-to-access areas.

## Power Consumption:
Efficacy in power consumption is one of the distinct features of the Tts2 L sensor. It uses a 3.6V AA lithium battery, ideal for long-term deployment. However, the battery's lifespan may vary based on the transmission frequency as well as environmental conditions.

## Use Cases:
The ELLENEX - Tts2 L is suitable for a wide range of applications, including:
1. Industrial monitoring and control: You can use this sensor for real-time monitoring of heating or cooling systems in factories.
2. Environmental monitoring: It is also suitable for checking environmental conditions in data centers, cold storage, and agricultural fields.

## Limitations:
While the ELLENEX - Tts2 L offers numerous benefits, several limitations are worth noting:
1. Limited Transmission Range: Although LoRaWAN offers long-range communication, physical obstacles like walls or large machinery can affect the transmission range.
2. Non-rechargeable Battery: The sensor comes with a non-rechargeable battery. When the battery dies, replacement is necessary.
3. Temperature and Pressure Range: The sensor may not perform accurately if the temperature or pressure goes beyond the maximum range defined by the manufacturer. Please refer to the technical specifications for exact functioning ranges. 

Overall, the ELLENEX - Tts2 L is an efficient and dependable solution for various temperature and pressure monitoring applications. Remember to review and adhere to the installation procedures for optimal use.
