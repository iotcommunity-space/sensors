**Technical Overview of ELLENEX - Ptc2 L**

**Overview:**

The ELLENEX - Ptc2 L sensor is a fully integrated, robust sensor designed for accurate, continuous pressure and temperature measurements. This sensor is engineered for low-power operation, making it perfect for integration within IoT networks. 

**Working Principle:**

Within ELLENEX - Ptc2 L, the pressure measurement component performs based on the principle of piezoresistivity, where pressure changes affect electrical resistance yielding measurable quantities. The temperature sensor is a Platinum Resistance Thermometer (PRT) that changes resistance values with alterations in temperature; providing accurate temperature details. The results from both the pressure and temperature sensors are then converted into digital data by an analog-to-digital converter.

**Installation Guide:**

Installation of ELLENEX - Ptc2 L must be performed by a trained professional. The sensor can be installed into the system through its mounting thread to ensure a secure fit. Once securely mounted, connect the sensor to the system's hardware via its interface cable, following the provided step-by-step procedures. The specific software associated with this sensor must then be installed and configured on your computer system.

**LoRaWAN Details:**

ELLENEX - Ptc2 L is a LoRaWAN class A device. Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) is a protocol designed for wireless battery-operated devices in a regional, national, or global network. LoRaWAN targets key requirements of IoT such as secure bi-directional communication, mobility, and localization services. 

**Power Consumption:**

ELLENEX - Ptc2 L sensor is designed with low-power consumption in mind. It utilizes approximately 130 mA during regular operation, and can last for years on a single battery charge, depending upon its configuration and data transmission frequency.

**Use Cases:**

ELLENEX - Ptc2 L finds application in various fields. It's primarily used in industrial settings, where continuous and accurate pressure and temperature measurements are essential. It could be used in oil and gas industries, chemical industries, HVAC applications, etc. Its accurate measurements can play a vital role in maintaining optimal operating conditions and preventing catastrophic failures in these systems.

**Limitations:**

Every technical piece has its limitations:

1. ELLENEX - Ptc2 L is not intended for extreme temperature or pressure conditions outside the specific ranges specified by the manufacturer.
2. Accurate readings heavily rely on prompt and regular calibration. 
3. Due to its low power consumption, the sensor might not provide real-time readings under high-frequency requirements. 
4. The sensor is sensitive to physical impacts and should not be utilized in systems that are supposed to sustain heavy knockings or vibrations.
5. The sensor should not be installed in areas with a high likelihood of submersion or an excessively moist environment. 

In Conclusion, ELLENEX - Ptc2 L is a robust pressure and temperature sensor that integrates seamlessly into IoT systems, offering potential for significantly improved operating efficiency.
