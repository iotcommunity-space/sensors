**Technical Overview - ELLENEX - Plm2 L (ELLENEX)**

**1. Working Principles:**

The ELLENEX PLM2 L is a high-precision pressure sensor device that operates on the principle of piezoresistive effect. It converts pressure into an analog electrical signal. The pressure measurement is done by detecting a deviation in resistance, which changes in response to the applied pressure on the sensor membrane. These values are then transmitted via LoRaWAN for real-time monitoring.

**2. Installation Guide:**

* Identify an optimal position for installation based on the area you wish to monitor.
* Mount the pressure sensor using provided attachments. Sensor installation varies depending on whether it's installed on pipes, in tanks, etc.
* Connect the sensor to the power source and ensure that it is fully powered and functional.
* Connect the sensor to your LoRaWAN network, ensuring that its proximity allows communication.
* Configure the sensor parameters using the manufacturer-provided guide.

**3. LoRaWAN Details:**

The ELLENEX PLM2 L employs LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) technology, a high-capacity, long-range, low-power wireless network designed for IoT devices. The advantage of using LoRaWAN is its ability to communicate effectively over large distances without significant power consumption. The device supports LoRaWAN protocol 1.0.2, operating in multiple frequency bands, providing robust and reliable wireless communication.

**4. Power Consumption:**

The ELLENEX PLM2 L is designed for low power consumption, primarily because it operates on battery power. The power consumption rate depends on the operational mode and the frequency of data reporting. Generally, with consistent use and optimal conditions, the battery life can last for several years.

**5. Use Cases:**

* **Industrial Automation:** The sensor can be used to monitor pressure in various machines, improving efficiency and safety.
* **Water Management:** It can monitor the pressure in water distribution systems, helping in leak detection and proper resource allocation.
* **Oil & Gas Sector:** The sensor can be used in pipelines for regular and accurate pressure checks, contributing to safety and efficiency.
  
**6. Limitations:**

* While the sensor is indeed robust and designed to work in harsh environments, it remains sensitive to extreme conditions such as very high pressures and temperatures.
* The sensor requires a clear LoRaWAN connection to maintain regular updates of its data. In areas with high interference or limited LoRaWAN coverage, the sensor might not function optimally. 
* Battery life of the sensor can be a limitation if the device is configured for frequent data transmission. Proper interval setup is crucial. 

*The ELLENEX PLM2 L is designed to perform in a variety of conditions and offers reliable data collection and transmission for many pressure-related applications. However, these capabilities must be balanced against certain limitations, such as extreme operating conditions and coverage availability.*
