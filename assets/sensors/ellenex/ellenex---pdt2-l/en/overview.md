# ELLENEX - Pdt2 L (ELLENEX) Technical Overview

## Introduction
The ELLENEX - Pdt2 L, from ELLENEX, is an advanced pressure and temperature sensing device incorporating cutting-edge IoT technology. The sensor has been meticulously designed for monitoring, measuring, and transmitting both temperature and pressure data in diverse industrial applications. The sensor leverages the LoRaWAN protocol to communicate gathered pressure and temperature data to the central system across a wide geographic coverage area. 

## Working Principles
The ELLENEX-Pdt2 L sensor employs a piezoresistive silicon chip for precise pressure measurement coupled with a platinum-based RTD for temperature measurement. The Garnet sealed sensor performs the task of data collection right at the surface of where pressure is applied, providing real-time readings of pressure and temperature levels. The device then transmits the recorded data to gateway devices using the LoRaWAN wireless communication system, making an IoT network for seamless data transmission and analysis.

## Installation Guide 
Installing your ELLENEX-Pdt2 L sensor involves the following steps:

1. Ensure the installation site is safe and compatible with the sensor parameters. 
2. Carefully unpack the sensor and check for all the necessary components. 
3. Connect the sensor using the provided cable to the device where you want to measure pressure and temperature. 
4. Once connected, power up your sensor.
5. Connect your device to your LoRaWAN network by following your network instructions for new device inclusion.
6. Once successfully connected to the network, you can monitor the readings via your LoRaWAN network platform.

## LoRaWAN Details
LoRaWAN is a media access control (MAC) protocol for wide-area networks aimed at managing communication between LPWAN gateways and end-node devices as part of the LoRa Alliance's LoRaWAN standard. The ELLENEX-Pdt2 L is LoRaWAN 1.0.2 compatible and can communicate at several frequencies depending on the region, with data rates of up to 50 kbps.

## Power Consumption
The ELLENEX-Pdt2 L is a low-power device designed for extensive deployment in IoT networks. It's equipped with a 3.6V lithium battery that can last for more than two years dependent on usage and configuration.

## Use Cases
Given its ability to perform dual tasks of pressure and temperature measurement, this device finds usage across diverse industries:

1. In healthcare settings, the ELLENEX-Pdt2 L sensor can be used in continuous monitoring of patient vitals.
2. It's vital for industrial applications in monitoring and controlling process parameters in manufacturing settings, providing data useful for optimizing energy consumption and predicting equipment failure.
3. In agricultural contexts, this sensor can be used for monitoring soil moisture and temperature, contributing to improved crop management.

## Limitations
While the ELLENEX-Pdt2 L is highly versatile, it does have some limitations:

1. It requires a clean environment for accurate readings and cannot be used in environments where the sensor might get coated or clogged with dirt or dust.
2. It needs a LoRaWAN network for communication. If this network is not accessible or becomes unreliable, the sensor will fail to transmit the collected data.
3. Battery life will decrease faster in areas with poor network coverage, as the device will need to use more power to maintain a connection.
4. The pressure and temperature ranges of this sensor may not be suitable for extremely high or low range applications.
   
The ELLENEX-Pdt2 L is a sophisticated sensor device that delivers consistent and real-time data in various conditions, hence making it a considerable choice for temperature and pressure data needs.
