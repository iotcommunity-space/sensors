**Technical Overview for ELLENEX – Pld2 L**

**Working Principles**

The ELLENEX – Pld2 L is a pressure and level sensor used for monitoring and measuring data in various industrial settings. The sensor works on the principle of differential pressure and it measures the liquid level by calculating the difference in pressure at the bottom and top of the tank.

The unit has a built-in microprocessor that uses a complex algorithm to analyze the data it receives from the sensor. This data is then converted into a digital format and sent to a host system where it can be viewed and analyzed. The sensor is remotely configurable allowing it to adjust to various tank sizes and shapes. 

**Installation Guide**

Installation of the ELLENEX – Pld2 L is straightforward and can be done quickly with the right tools. Follow these steps for a successful installation:

1. Identify the optimal point for sensor installation on the tank.
2. Use the provided screws to securely attach the sensor to the tank.
3. Connect the sensor to the power source.
4. Set up the LoRaWAN network (see below for details) and connect the sensor to the network for data transmission.

**LoRaWAN Details**

The Pld2 L uses the LoRaWAN protocol for communication, making it suitable for remote operations where WiFi or cellular coverage is not guaranteed. LoRaWAN is a low-power, long-range wireless communication protocol designed for IoT devices. 

The device is a Class A LoRaWAN-compliant, operating in various ISM bands, and can access any standard LoRaWAN gateway and network server. It follows the adaptive data rate (ADR) policy, extending the battery life, and optimizing data transfer.

**Power Consumption**

The device operates on a non-rechargeable 3.6V AA lithium battery. With an average of 20,000 transmissions per battery lifetime, its power consumption is optimized for longevity.

**Use Cases**

The Pld2 L is designed to operate in a variety of use cases, such as:

1. Monitoring and control of remotely located storage tanks in the oil and gas field.
2. Monitoring the level of liquids, sludges, and solid materials in sewage and treatment plants.
3. Water level monitoring in rivers, lakes, and dams.

**Limitations**

While ELLENEX - Pld2 L is a robust and flexible sensor, it does have a few limitations:

1. Dependence on LoRaWAN coverage: For remote or underground sites, an external antenna might be needed to relay the signal.
2. Calibration: It requires calibration to ensure accuracy. This might be complex in certain work scenarios.
3. Power source: Since it is battery operated, maintenance requires battery replacements.
4. Not suitable for hazardous environments: It doesn't have any intrinsic safety certification and thus, could not be installed in potentially explosive atmospheres.
5. Temperature Limits: The temperature range is from -15 to 60 degree Celsius, making the device unsuitable for extreme temperature environments.
   
Despite these limitations, the ELLENEX – Pld2 L remains a powerful choice for industries looking to track and monitor fluid levels in various scenarios.
