## Technical Overview for ELLENEX - Pts2 L (ELLENEX)

### Working Principles

The ELLENEX - Pts2 L is a pressure and temperature sensor suitable for tracking and monitoring both parameters over a broad scale of applications. The pressure transducer within the sensor converts a sensed pressure into an electrical signal, which is then measured and translated into pressure units. The temperature sensor operates on a similar principle, converting a sensed temperature into a proportional electrical output.

### Installation Guide

Installation of the ELLENEX - Pts2 L involves a few steps:

1. **Location**: Find an optimal location for the sensor, inside or around the system that requires monitoring. Prefer a location that has minimal exposure to severe temperature fluctuations and electromagnetic interferences.

2. **Mounting**: Properly secure the sensor to the chosen location using the provided mounting kit. Make sure to avoid overtightening.

3. **Connection**: For power and data communication, connect the sensor to the network via the cable provided. The username and password would have been provided in the documentation.

4. **Configuration**: Follow the steps in the product manual to configure the sensor to be recognized by the network. You can also set your preferred pressure and temperature units in this step.

### LoRaWAN

The device is compatible with LoRaWAN (Long Range, Wide Area Network), a protocol designed for wireless battery-operated devices used in regional, national, or global networks. It delivers low-cost and efficient power utilization, allowing long-term deployments. 

To properly set up the device according to LoRaWAN standards, always make sure to configure the device within range of the LoRaWAN gateway and register it with the network server.

### Power Consumption

The ELLENEX - Pts2 L sensor is designed for low power consumption, supporting a long battery life of up to two years depending on usage. This sensor operates on a voltage of 3.6 Volts. Power consumption varies depending upon the operating conditions and the sensor's data transmission intervals.

### Use Cases

ELLENEX - Pts2 L can be employed in areas that require constant pressure and temperature monitoring, such as:

- Industrial automation 
- HVAC systems
- Water management
- Gas pressure monitoring 
- Agricultural systems

### Limitations

Although the ELLENEX - Pts2 L exhibits numerous strengths, some potential limitations include:

- Distance: The sensor's connection may become unreliable over long distance communication, especially if out of range of the LoRaWAN gateway.

- Environmental Conditions: The sensor's performance can be impacted by drastic temperature fluctuations and electromagnetic interferences.

- Configuration: Improper configuration can lead to inaccurate readings. It is crucial to follow the user guide to properly setup and calibrate the sensor data. 

- Battery Life: The battery life, although long, can be significantly shortened with frequent data transmission. 

In conclusion, the ELLENEX - Pts2 L is a robust and reliable sensing device for a wide range of pressure and temperature monitoring applications within its specified operational boundaries.
