## ELLENEX - Plv2 L (ELLENEX) Technical Overview

### Working principles
The ELLENEX - Plv2 L is a high-precision pressure sensor designed to generate precise measurements in a wide range of industrial applications. It operates based on the principle of pressure transduction, where it converts the physical pressure into electrical signals which are then transmitted to a server for data processing and analysis. The device is designed to operate in extreme environmental conditions and has a robust structure that provides high-accuracy pressure measurement.

### Installation Guide
To install the ELLENEX - Plv2 L sensor, follow these steps:

1. Clear the area of any potential debris.
2. Position the sensor at the desired location ensuring a stable and secure fit.
3. Connect the sensor output wires to an appropriate power source and data reading equipment according to the deviceâ€™s wiring diagram.
4. Switch on the power source to start the sensor operation.
5. Check the connected system interface or your IoT platform to confirm that data is being received correctly.


### LoRaWAN Details
The ELLENEX - Plv2 L utilizes the Low Power Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) for effective and efficient data communication. This technology is designed to offer long-range connectivity, low power consumption, and secure data transmission. This sensor operates on a pre-established LoRaWAN frequency and it adheres to the LoRaWAN specification for the bidirectional communication of data, which ensures a connection with high signal strength and penetration capability.

### Power Consumption
The ELLENEX - Plv2 L is designed to operate efficiently under low power conditions. It is optimized for maximum battery life, ensuring long-term usability without frequent battery replacement. As an IoT device, it sleeps when not in active use to save energy, making it ideal for remote or hard-to-access locations where frequent battery changes may be impractical.

### Use Cases
The ELLENEX - Plv2 L sensor can be used across various sectors. In the industrial environment, it helps monitor pressure in pipelines, tanks, and other machinery to help prevent malfunctions or accidents. In the agricultural sector, it can monitor soil or water pressure, ensuring optimal conditions for crop growth. Additionally, it can be used in environmental monitoring, measuring atmospheric pressure for weather forecasting.



### Limitations
While the ELLENEX - Plv2 L provides significant advantages, there are certain limitations. The LoRaWAN technology, although offering a strong range, may experience reduced connectivity in densely constructed areas, or extreme environmental conditions. The accuracy of the sensor may slightly reduce in environments with extremely high or low temperatures. The sensor also needs to be correctly calibrated to the specific range of pressure measurements for the intended application, as incorrect calibration may lead to inaccurate readings. Lastly, the device's casing although designed to be robust, may be susceptible to damage from direct impact or deliberate tampering.
