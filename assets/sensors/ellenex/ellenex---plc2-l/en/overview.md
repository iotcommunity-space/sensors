## ELLENEX - Plc2 L Overview

The ELLENEX - Plc2 L stands as a vital IoT device serving as a pressure sensor for multiple applications; from industrial automation to agricultural operations. 

### Working Principles

This sensor operates using piezoresistive technology. It measures variations in the applied pressure by detecting changes in the electrical resistance. It contains a pressure-sensitive element that deforms when exposed to pressure, causing a fluctuation in electrical conductivity. The device then converts this response into a readable digital output.

### Installation Guide

To install the ELLENEX - Plc2 L, the following steps should be carried out:

1. Prioritize the installation location to ensure consistent pressure readings.
2. Insert the connecting tubes into the device's input and output ports.
3. Connect the device to the desired power supply, ensuring that the provided voltage range is adhered to.
4. Following the manufacturer's instruction, configure the network settings to link to a LoRaWAN server.

### LoRaWAN Details

ELLENEX - Plc2 L utilizes the LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) technology which makes it perfect for setting up an IoT system in a larger area. Due to its long-range communication, power efficiency, and high capacity, the sensor offers impressive remote accessibility and control. Information is forwarded to a central server where it is processed and analyzed.

### Power Consumption

This power-efficient device consumes low power ensuring longevity and reliability. It is capable of drawing as low as 10 ÂµA during standby mode and approximately 12 mA during measurements, thus efficiently conserving battery life.

### Use Cases

The ELLENEX - Plc2 L sensor is versatile and finds use in various sectors:

1. **Industrial Automation**: Allows for real-time pressure monitoring and control contributing towards process efficiency and safety.
2. **Agricultural Farming**: Used for irrigation system management by monitoring water pressure and controlling water supply.
3. **Civil Engineering & Construction**: Facilitates in tracking and control of hydraulic pressure in heavy machinery.

### Limitations

While ELLENEX - Plc2 L is robust and versatile, it has a few limitations:

1. **Interference**: The pressure sensor may give inaccurate readings in environments with high electromagnetic noise.

2. **Temperature Influence**: Device performance may get affected by extreme temperatures.

3. **Overload**: The sensor could breach its limit under extreme pressure, potentially causing damage to its components.

4. **LoRaWAN limitations**: Bandwidth and data transfer speeds are lower compared to other IoT wireless technologies like 5G or Wi-Fi. Works best in environments where devices can afford low data rate and latency.

Overall, the ELLENEX - Plc2 L represents a reliable IoT pressure sensor option, being energy-efficient, and providing long-range communication and vast application opportunities.
