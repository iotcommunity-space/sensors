## Technical Overview for ELLENEX â€“ Pte2 L (ELLENEX)

ELLENEX - Pte2 L is a state-of-the-art wireless sensor designed to measure and monitor temperature and pressure in various environments. Utilizing the LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) protocol, the device is optimized for significant energy efficiency and extended range performance, catering to several IoT (Internet of Things) applications in various sectors such as healthcare, agriculture, manufacturing, and more.

### Working Principles

1. **Data Collection**: The sensor collects temperature and pressure data from the surrounding environment.
2. **Data Conversion and Transmission**: The collected analog data is converted into digital signals and transmitted over the LoRaWAN to a dedicated gateway.
3. **Cloud Connectivity**: The data is then sent to a cloud server where it is stored, processed, and analyzed. The system makes this data available for visualization, monitoring, and decision-making purposes.

### Installation Guide

1. Position the sensor in the desired location. Ensure it is in a spot where it can accurately measure the temperature and pressure of the environment.
2. Connect the sensor to your LoRaWAN gateway using the product-specific onboarding key.
3. Use the EllENEX software platform to configure reporting intervals and alarm trigger points.
4. Periodically check the sensor status and battery level to maintain data accuracy and system performance.

### LoRaWAN Details

The LoRaWAN protocol, an integral feature of the ELLENEX - Pte2 L, is a low power, long-range and wide-area networking protocol that allows devices to communicate with IoT applications over long ranges. It uses the ISM (Industrial, Scientific, and Medical) bands, free frequency bands that vary depending on the region. This sensor supports adaptive data rate (ADR), and ensures excellent penetration in built-up areas.

### Power Consumption

ELLENEX - Pte2 L has a very low power consumption profile. It operates on a Lithium 3.6V AAA battery that can last for several months to a year, depending on the frequency of data transmissions and environmental factors. 

### Use Cases

The ELLENEX - Pte2 L sensor is versatile in its applications. It has been successfully deployed in various scenarios, which include:

1. Agriculture: Monitoring climate conditions in greenhouses.
2. Healthcare: Monitoring room temperature and pressure in hospitals and laboratories.
3. Manufacturing: Monitoring industrial processes that require specific pressure and temperature conditions.
4. Environmental Monitoring: Monitoring weather conditions, specifically temperature and pressure, in smart city applications.

### Limitations

The sensor's limitations revolve around its operational boundaries. It is not recommended for use in environments with extreme temperatures or pressures out of its specified range. Also, its range and battery life can be affected by various factors, including building materials, the number and type of obstacles between the sensor and gateway, and the quality of power supply. In addition, data accuracy is directly affected by its placement and installation, and it requires a LoRaWAN gateway for functioning.
