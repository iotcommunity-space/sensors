Title: Technical Overview of ELLENEX – Pds2 L (ELLENEX)

I. Overview

The ELLENEX – Pds2 L is an advanced IoT device designed to monitor pressure remotely using sensor technology. It functions via electrical resistance change, which is influenced by external pressure changes. The information is processed by an integrated module that interprets the data and sends it via the LoRaWAN network to the monitoring system.

II. Working Principles

The Pds2 L operates on the principle of piezoresistance. Pressure changes in its operating environment result in variation of its electrical resistance, which is measured, processed, and converted into data representing the monitored pressure. The processed data is then sent through the built-in LoRaWAN module, allowing the information to be viewed on a connected system for pressure monitoring and analysis.

III. Installation Guide

Installation of the Pds2 L involves both physical setup and network connection. 

Physical setup includes:
- Powering the device with an attached battery or external power supply.
- Installing the device at the intended measurement location, ensuring a clear path for signal transmission.

For network connection:

- Configure it to connect to the local LoRaWAN network by setting up the network parameters using the provided management software.
- After successful network configuration, test data transmission to confirm network connection and data transmission.

IV. LoRaWAN Details

The Pds2 L is equipped with a LoRaWAN module for low-power, long-range communication. It operates on the sub-GHz spectrum allowing data transmission over longer ranges while using minimal power. 

V. Power Consumption

The ELLENEX – Pds2 L is designed with energy efficiency in mind. It features a low power consumption design, enabling it to sustain operations for extended periods even when powered by batteries. 

VI. Use Cases

The Pds2 L is suitable in applications requiring remote pressure monitoring in real-time. Common use cases include:
- Environmental monitoring: measuring pressure variations in meteorological stations.
- Industrial Usage: pressure tracking in pipelines and tanks etc.
- Aquaculture: monitoring water pressure in tanks and ponds to maintain optimal conditions for aquatic life.

VII. Limitations

The device's functionality may be affected by egregiously harsh conditions. For example, subjecting the Pds2 L to extremely high pressures may potentially damage the sensor. Additionally, while the LoRaWAN module enables long-range data transfers, its effectiveness can be reduced by obstacles in the signal path or strong electromagnetic interference. Also, as with any IoT device, its performance is dependent on power availability. The device may not function optimally if the battery power is low.
