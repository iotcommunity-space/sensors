# ELLENEX - Pls3 L Technical Overview

## Working Principles

The ELLENEX - Pls3 L is a highly advanced, low maintenance, and battery-powered pressure sensor, mainly designed for level measurement through a pipe or riser. The principle of operation of Pls3 L is based on the conversion of pressure into an electrical signal. Due to gravity, the pressure at any point in a column of fluid is proportional to the height of the fluid above that point. Therefore, the sensor measures the pressure exerted by the column of fluid above it, which can be used to calculate the fluid level or depth.

## Installation Guide

1. Position the Pls3 L device at the point which needs pressure monitoring, ensuring the device is vertically mounted, with the diaphragm in a horizontal position.
2. Fix the sensor to the structure, ensuring that the sensor's vent is not obstructed.
3. Connect the device to the gateway using the LoRaWAN network.
4. Configure the sensor parameters through the gateway's web interface or through the ELLENEX Platform.

## LoRaWAN Details

The Pls3 L is powered by LoRaWAN technology, a long-range and low-power wireless protocol that's used for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. The sensing device communicates with the gateway using LoRaWAN protocol to provide seamless connectivity. The device supports LoRaWAN class A, with the operating frequency differing as per the region (868 MHz for EU, 915 MHz for US). An Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) mechanism is implemented to optimize data transmission based on the proximity of the device to the gateway.

## Power Consumption

The ELLENEX - Pls3 L operates from a built-in long-life lithium battery for up to ten years, depending on the frequency of readings. The device is also designed with energy-efficient electronics that ensure low power consumption, thereby extending battery lifespan.

## Use Cases

Pls3 L sensors are widely utilized in various sectors, including:

1. Water management: Monitoring the water level in tanks, reservoirs, wells, and dams.
2. Oil & Gas industry: Determining fluid level in storage tanks.
3. Agriculture: For soil moisture recording and irrigation control.

## Limitations

1. The sensor's battery cannot be replaced or recharged, so once depleted, the entire device needs replacement.
2. It may not operate efficiently in highly congested LoRaWAN networks.
3. The device is not suitable for measurement in corrosive liquids as it may damage the diaphragm.
4. Though the device can operate in a wide temperature range, extreme temperatures may affect accuracy.
5. It requires a LoRaWAN gateway within range for operation. If the signal is obstructed or too weak, the device may fail to transmit data. 

## Conclusion

The ELLENEX - Pls3 L is an efficient and reliable solution for pressure level and depth measurement in numerous applications. Despite its limitations, the device's long battery life, seamless wireless connectivity, and robust performance outweigh its drawbacks.
