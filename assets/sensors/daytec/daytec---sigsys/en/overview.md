## Technical Overview of DAYTEC - Sigsys (DAYTEC) Sensor

### Introduction
The DAYTEC - Sigsys (DAYTEC) is an advanced IoT sensor designed for remote monitoring applications, leveraging LoRaWAN technology for efficient and long-range wireless communication. Tailored for various smart industry applications, it offers robust data collection capabilities with minimal energy consumption.

### Working Principles
DAYTEC operates on the principles of precise data acquisition and transmission. It integrates multiple environmental sensors possibly including temperature, humidity, and pressure sensors, which continuously monitor environmental variables. Data collected by these sensors is then transmitted to a centralized server for analysis via LoRaWAN, ensuring long-range data transmission with low power requirements.

### Installation Guide
1. **Site Selection**: Choose an installation site within the recommended proximity to a LoRaWAN gateway for optimal connectivity.
2. **Mounting**: Securely mount the DAYTEC sensor using the provided brackets or adhesive, depending on the surface and environmental conditions.
3. **Power Connection**: Insert batteries or connect to a specified power source, adhering to the voltage and amperage requirements outlined in the user manual.
4. **Configuration**:
   - Access the DAYTEC configuration interface via the mobile app or web dashboard.
   - Select network parameters and input any required encryption keys or access credentials for secure data transmission.
   - Configure the sampling rate and operational parameters according to the intended use case.
5. **Testing**: Perform a preliminary test to ensure that data transmission is successful and sensor readings are accurate.

### LoRaWAN Details
- **Frequency Band**: Operates on sub-GHz ISM bands, typically between 868 MHz (EU) and 915 MHz (US).
- **Network Compatibility**: Complies with LoRaWAN 1.0.3 Protocol or higher.
- **Data Rate**: Supports adaptive data rates from 0.3 kbps to 27 kbps to maximize battery life and efficiently manage communication range.
