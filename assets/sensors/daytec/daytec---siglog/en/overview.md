## DAYTEC - Siglog (DAYTEC) Technical Overview

### Working Principles

DAYTEC - Siglog is a cutting-edge IoT device designed for capturing and transmitting environmental data. The sensor operates on the principle of acquiring data from the environment, processing the data, and transmitting it over a network for storage and further analysis.

DAYTEC - Siglog is integrated with multiple sensors such as temperature, humidity, pressure, light intensity, and gas sensors. These sensors capture specific environmental data and the data is then processed by an embedded processor within the device.

### Installation Guide

DAYTEC - Siglog is designed to be user-friendly and easy to install. Follow these steps to install the device:

1. Identify a strategic point where the sensor can capture the most relevant data.
2. Ensure the device is within coverage of the LoRaWAN network.
3. Attach the device to the chosen location and secure it.
4. Connect the device to a power source if required.
5. Turn on the device and follow the user manual to configure and pair the device with the LoRaWAN network.

### LoRaWAN Details

DAYTEC - Siglog uses LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) for data transmission. LoRaWAN is a protocol specifically designed for low power consumption and long-range communication, which makes it suitable for IoT applications. The device uses LoRaWAN class A, which is the most energy-efficient class of LoRa devices.

### Power Consumption

DAYTEC - Siglog is designed with energy efficiency in mind. The power consumption of the device largely depends on the frequency of acquiring and transmitting data. However, Siglog has been optimized to work on low-power settings, making it suitable for long-term deployments without the need for frequent battery replacements.

### Use Cases

DAYTEC - Siglog can be used across various sectors and industries with the need to monitor environmental parameters. Here are a few use cases:

1. **Agriculture:** Farmers can use Siglog devices to monitor conditions such as soil moisture, temperature, and light intensity, aiding in informed decision-making for improved crop yield.
2. **Environmental Research:** Researchers can use Siglog to track changes in environmental parameters over time.
3. **Smart Cities:** Siglog can be used to monitor air quality within a city, providing data that can help manage and mitigate pollution levels.

### Limitations

While DAYTEC - Siglog is a versatile device, it has some limitations:

1. Siglog's operation depends on the coverage of the LoRaWAN network. In areas without sufficient network coverage, the device may fail to transmit data.
2. Siglog is designed for ambient data capture and may not perform optimally in extreme conditions such as very high or low temperatures.
3. The deviceâ€™s power consumption is low but not zero. If the frequency of data acquisition and transmission is high, battery lifespan may shorten and frequent battery replacements may be needed.
4. Data accuracy is dependent on sensor calibration. Over time and under certain environmental conditions, sensor accuracy may degrade, which would require recalibration.
