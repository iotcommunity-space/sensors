# Technical Overview: ATIM - Mr2 Ex

The ATIM - Mr2 Ex is a robust and versatile sensor designed specifically for industrial environments requiring intrinsically safe devices. It operates on the LoRaWAN protocol, enabling wide-area connectivity for IoT applications. The device is particularly suitable for monitoring applications in hazardous areas like chemical plants, oil refineries, and other ATEX classified zones.

## Working Principles

The ATIM - Mr2 Ex is designed to operate seamlessly in environments where explosion risks are present. It functions by capturing various parameters, such as temperature, humidity, or pressure depending on the configured sensors, and transmitting the data over the LoRaWAN network. This is achieved through a combination of specialized internal components and circuits that are compliant with ATEX standards, ensuring safety without compromising performance.

### Key Components:
- **Sensors**: The device can be equipped with different sensors depending on the monitoring needs, including temperature, pressure, humidity, or even custom sensors.
- **LoRaWAN Module**: Enables long-range communication with low power consumption. It uses the ISM radio bands (typically in the 868 MHz or 915 MHz frequencies) to ensure stable and secure wireless data transmission.
- **Power Supply**: Utilizes a long-life battery specifically designed for use in explosive environments, minimizing the risk of sparks.

## Installation Guide

### Pre-Installation Requirements:
1. **Site Assessment**: Ensure that the installation site is ATEX certified and that the specific Ex classification aligns with the device's rating.
2. **Network Configuration**: Prior to installation, network parameters such as AppEUI, DevEUI, and AppKey should be configured. These can be set up using ATIM's configuration software or via over-the-air activation (OTAA) for LoRaWAN.

### Installation Steps:
1. **Mounting**: Secure the device to a stable surface using the mounting options provided. Ensure the device is located within the range of a LoRaWAN gateway and in an area where the signal is unobstructed.
2. **Connection**: If external sensors are involved, connect them to the designated slots ensuring all connections are secure and comply with ATEX safety regulations.
3. **Power Up**: Initiate the device by securing the battery pack. Ensure the casing is properly sealed to maintain the integrity of the ATEX protection.
4. **Configuration**: Finalize the device settings via the ATIM configuration tool. Include setting the desired sampling rates and threshold values for alerts.
5. **Testing**: Conduct a series of tests to ensure data is being transmitted properly and the device is functioning as expected.

## LoRaWAN Details

The Mr2 Ex leverages LoRaWAN Class A protocol for uplink communication, ensuring efficient power usage and reliable data transmission. Important LoRaWAN features include:

- **Dynamic Data Rates**: Utilizes adaptive data rates (ADR) to optimize network capacity and battery life.
- **Security**: Employs 128-bit AES encryption to secure data in both the network and application layers.
- **Scalability**: Supports operation in dense environments with numerous devices.

## Power Consumption

Operating with an intrinsically safe battery pack, the Mr2 Ex is designed for efficient energy use:

- **Standby Mode**: Low-energy consumption during idle periods.
- **Operational Mode**: Utilizes advanced energy-saving techniques to maximize battery life, especially important in hard-to-reach locations.

Expect battery life to range from several years, contingent on the frequency of data transmission and environment conditions.

## Use Cases

- **Hazardous Environment Monitoring**: Ideal for chemical plants and oil refineries for tracking environmental conditions.
- **Industrial Equipment Monitoring**: Provides vital stats such as temperature and pressure in machinery, ensuring maintenance before failures occur.
- **Smart City Deployments**: Used in metropolitan areas for monitoring air quality and environmental parameters from safe distances.

## Limitations

- **Limited Sensor Options**: While designed for specific industrial use, customization is required for non-standard sensor types.
- **Transmission Range**: Although effective in open spaces, obstacles such as thick walls can impede LoRaWAN signals.
- **Data Latency**: As a trade-off for low power usage, the data transmission rate may not support real-time critical operations.

The ATIM - Mr2 Ex sensor is a robust solution for monitoring in challenging and hazardous environments with specific requirements for power consumption, safety, and wireless communication. It is designed to bring reliability and efficiency to critical monitoring tasks, though users must be mindful of its range and customization limitations.
