# ATIM - Mr2 Ex Technical Overview 

## Introduction

ATIM-Mr2 Ex (Armature Technologies Input Module– Double Entry version) is a LoRaWAN-enabled sensor module, developed by ATIM Company. It is designed primarily for Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) applications. This device utilizes the LoRaWAN technology, which follows a long-range, low power wide area network protocol designed to connect devices over extensive distances in challenging environments.

## Working Principles 

ATIM-Mr2 Ex acquires data from the attached sensors and transmits it to the network server via the LoRaWAN gateway using bi-directional communication. It features two analog and digital inputs, making it versatile for a wide array of applications.

The device has an embedded ultra-low-power LoRa transceiver, which ensures reliable and secure transmission of information over long distances. 

## LoRaWAN Details

The ATIM-Mr2 Ex operates under various Eu ISM bands, compatible with several LoRaWAN classes (default class A). The device supports Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) mode and allows both OTAA and ABP activation types. The sensor follows the LoRaWan 1.0.2 protocol. 

## Power Consumption 

ATIM - Mr2 Ex is designed for low power consumption, maximizing battery life. Its power consumption levels rely significantly on the data transmission frequency and the distance from the nearest LoRaWAN gateway. The device requires a 3.6V, ER14505 battery. However, it is not provided along with the device and should be acquired separately.

## Installation Guide 

Installation of the ATIM-Mr2 Ex involves the following steps:

1. Mounting the device: Select a location without physical obstacles, minimizing distance to the LoRaWAN gateway. 
2. Connecting the sensors: Connect chosen sensors to the two available input channels.
3. Battery insertion: Open the module and insert the ER14505 battery.
4. Configuration: Configure the device using ATIM’s ACW Proprietary tool or OTAA activation via the LoRaWAN network.
5. Closure: Tightly close the module to maintain its IP67 rating.

## Use Cases 

ATIM - Mr2 Ex is highly adaptable and used in several IIoT applications including:

1. Machinery condition monitoring: By connecting vibration or temperature sensors to monitor equipment health.
2. Environmental monitoring: By attaching humidity, light, or air quality sensors. 
3. Energy efficiency applications: By integrating with different power consumption sensors. 

## Limitations 

Although ATIM - Mr2 Ex is highly versatile, it has some limitations. The data transmission is limited by the LoRaWAN's duty cycle regulations, which could delay data readings. Furthermore, it may experience signal loss or degradation in highly obstructed environments or when deployed over large distances.

Lastly, ATIM - Mr2 Ex is dependent on the availability of a LoRaWAN network, and the device's robustness could be affected without a proper gateway in place. 

In conclusion, ATIM - Mr2 Ex offers a flexible option for diverse IoT applications, but its deployment and performance are highly dependent on the environment and LoRaWAN protocol constraints.
