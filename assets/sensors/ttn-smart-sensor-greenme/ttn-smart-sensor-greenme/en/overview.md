**Technical Overview - TTN Smart Sensor (Greenme)**

1. **Working Principles**
The Things Network (TTN) Smart Sensor (Greenme) functions on the principles of Internet of Things (IoT) technology. It is designed to monitor and analyze the environmental factors in a given area. This smart sensor gathers data from the environment such as temperature, humidity, air quality, noise level, and more, then sends it through wireless communication to a specific server. The collected data is analyzed and used for assessing and controlling the environmental conditions.

2. **Installation Guide**
To install the Greenme sensor, identify a suitable location for the device based on the environmental parameters to be measured. Once the location is chosen, mount the sensor using the provided tools. Once installed, activate the device and connect it to the network either through a smartphone app or by a computer interface. After connecting to the desired network, the sensor will automatically start to gather and transmit data.

3. **LoRaWAN Details**
TTN Smart Sensor (Greenme) relies on the Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN), an open-standard allowing low-power devices to wirelessly connect to the internet for long-range applications. The information from the sensor is transmitted through a LoRa gateway into a network server which then transfers it into an application server. LoRaWANâ€™s unique feature is its long-range communication capability with reduced power consumption, making it ideal for IoT systems.

4. **Power Consumption**
The TTN Smart Sensor (Greenme) is a low-power device that operates extremely efficiently, leveraging the LoRaWAN technology that allows for significant power conservation. Though specific power consumption figures can vary based on usage and specific models, in general, TTN sensors are designed to operate on minimal power to facilitate long-term data collection and transmission.

5. **Use Cases**
The TTN Smart Sensor (Greenme) can be utilized in a variety of scenarios for environmental monitoring. In agriculture, for example, it can monitor soil conditions and weather parameters for precision farming. In smart city scenarios, it can monitor parameters like noise and air pollution. The device is also useful in warehouses for monitoring temperature and humidity, ensuring optimal conditions for stored goods. 

6. **Limitations**
While the TTN Smart Sensor (Greenme) is useful in many scenarios, it has certain limitations. The accuracy of its readings can depend on the sensor's position and the local environmental conditions. Being a wireless device, there could be scenarios where signal interference or weak signal strength might influence the performance. Additionally, while the sensor communicates over a long range, physical obstacles between the sensor and the LoRa gateway could potentially limit communication. Finally, while the low power usage is a benefit, it does require regular power source check-ups to ensure continuous operation.
