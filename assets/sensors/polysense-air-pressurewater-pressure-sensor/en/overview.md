### Technical Overview of POLYSENSE - Air Pressure/Water Pressure Sensor

#### Introduction
The POLYSENSE Air Pressure/Water Pressure Sensor is a robust and reliable device designed to monitor and transmit air and water pressure data over LoRaWAN networks. It is utilized in various industrial and environmental applications to ensure optimal performance across systems and is suitable for integrating into IoT ecosystems for real-time pressure data monitoring.

#### Working Principles

The POLYSENSE sensor operates based on the piezoresistive principle, utilizing a diaphragm and strain gauge. When air or water pressure is applied to the diaphragm, it causes a deformation which alters the resistance of the strain gauge. This change in resistance is converted into a millivolt signal, which is then processed to provide an accurate pressure reading. The sensor is calibrated to provide precise and reliable data across a specified pressure range.

#### Installation Guide

1. **Site Selection:** Choose an optimal location where the sensor is protected from physical damage and environmental extremes. Consider accessibility for maintenance.
   
2. **Mounting:** Secure the sensor using appropriate mounting brackets or fixtures. Ensure the sensor is aligned correctly with the pressure source, whether it be air ducts, pipes, or open-air environments.
   
3. **Connection:** Connect the sensor to the pressure source using compatible fittings. Ensure all connections are tight and leak-proof.
   
4. **Configuration:** Use the provided software or mobile app to configure the device. Set the pressure range, data transmission intervals, and LoRa parameters.
   
5. **Powering On:** Connect the power supply, which may involve installing batteries or interfacing with external power lines.

6. **Testing:** Validate the installation by testing the sensor with known pressure values to ensure accurate readings.
