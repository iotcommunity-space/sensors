## MIOTIQ - Custom Miotiq (MIOTIQ) Technical Overview

### Working Principles
MIOTIQ functions based on the principle of the Internet of Things (IoT), where devices are interlinked to ensure efficient and streamlined coordination. It primarily operates through a Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) technology, which optimizes power consumption and maximizes transmission distance. 

### Installation Guide
MIOTIQ can be installed in a few easy steps:
1. Power the device: Connect the device to power its supply and ensure it is effectively receiving power.
2. Configuration: Connect the device to the configuration portal (usually through Wi-Fi) and input your LoRaWAN network credentials.
3. Mount the Device: Position the device at your desired location ensuring there are no significant obstacles that could affect signal transmission.
4. Connect to LoRaWAN network: Once mounted, the device will automatically connect to the LoRaWAN network.

### LoRaWAN Details
LoRaWAN, or Long Range Wide Area Network, serves as the communication protocol for MIOTIQ. It ensures robust and secure transmission of data over large coverage areas, making it ideal for IoT applications. MIOTIQ utilizes this communication protocol to achieve optimized power usage and long-range communication. It operates on a frequency that complies with the LoRaWAN standard, ensuring compatibility with existing LoRaWAN gateways.

### Power Consumption
The power consumption of the MIOTIQ custom sensor is significantly low, making it suitable for long-term operations without frequent battery replacement. However, power consumption may vary based on the frequency of data transmissions and environmental conditions. 

### Use Cases
MIOTIQ sensors can be used to monitor an array of parameters across different industries:

• Agriculture: measuring soil moisture levels, temperature, and humidity for optimal crop growth.

• Smart Cities: managing public utilities like water and electricity meters.

• Supply Chain and Logistics: monitoring the integrity of goods and their conditions in transit. 

• Industrial: machinery performance and preventive maintenance.

### Limitations
Although versatile and powerful, the MIOTIQ sensor has some limitations:

• Signal Interference: While LoRaWAN protocol is designed to overcome interference, extreme environmental conditions may affect signal strength.

• Limited Onboard Processing Power: Due to its low power design, MIOTIQ is not suitable for applications that require high computational power.

• Non-Real-Time Data Transmission: While the device can transmit data over long distances, it is not designed for real-time applications due to inherent LoRaWAN latency. 

Despite these limitations, the MIOTIQ provides a cost-efficient and robust solution for a diverse range of IoT applications. Through proper configuration and implementation, users can significantly benefit from long-distance, low-power data transmission using the MIOTIQ sensor.
