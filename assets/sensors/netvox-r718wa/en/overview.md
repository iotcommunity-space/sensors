## Technical Overview for NETVOX - R718Wa 

### Overview

The NETVOX R718Wa is a wireless LoRaWAN-enabled water leak detector designed for use in IoT environments. It offers reliable, long-range data transmission with low power consumption, making it suitable for various industrial and commercial applications involving water detection and management.

### Working Principles

The R718Wa operates using capacitive sensing principles to detect water presence. It features a sensor probe that can reliably identify water contact. When the probe detects water, the unit transmits a signal over the LoRaWAN network, alerting users to potential leaks or flooding. The device includes an internal microcontroller for managing sensor data and communication protocols.

### Installation Guide

1. **Unpack the Device:** Carefully remove the sensor and its components from the packaging, ensuring all parts are present and undamaged.

2. **Select Location:** Identify suitable locations for placing the leak probe. Ideal spots are around possible leak sources, such as under pipes, near water heaters, or around HVAC systems.

3. **Mount the Sensor:** Secure the main unit on a wall or flat surface using screws or adhesive pads. Ensure the position allows unobstructed communication with your LoRaWAN gateway.

4. **Place the Probe:** Position the probe at the desired location. It should lay flat on the surface where leakage is most likely to occur. Avoid tension in the cable between the sensor and the probe.

5. **Connect the Device:** Ensure the sensor probe is properly connected to the main unit.

6. **Power On:** Insert the provided batteries into the unit, aligning the polarity as indicated.

7. **Enroll in Network:** Use the provided network keys to add the device to your LoRaWAN network. Follow your network provider's procedures for device registration and activation.

8. **Testing:** Once connected, simulate a leak by placing the probe in contact with water and check for alert notification to confirm successful setup and connectivity.

### LoRaWAN Details

- **Frequency Bands:** R718Wa supports several LoRa frequency bands (EU868, US915, AS923, etc.), chosen based on regional requirements.
- **Device Class:** It operates as a Class A device, meaning it has low-power communication with downlink receive windows after every uplink transmission.
- **Data Rate:** Adaptable data rate using ADR (Adaptive Data Rate) to optimize battery life and network capacity.
- **Security:** Utilizes AES-128 encryption to ensure secure communications over the network.

### Power Consumption

The R718Wa is engineered for low power consumption, typically powered by AA-sized Lithium batteries which can last several years under normal operation (depending on environmental conditions and data transmission frequency). The power consumption during sleep mode is minimal, maximizing battery lifespan.

### Use Cases

- **Commercial Buildings:** Early detection of leaks in office complexes, helping prevent structural damage and costly repairs.
- **Industrial Facilities:** Monitoring for leaks in factories or storage units where water management is critical.
- **Residential Homes:** Offering peace of mind to homeowners by alerting them to potential flooding situations in basements or laundry rooms.
- **Data Centers:** Protecting sensitive equipment from water damage by alerting any fluid presence in server rooms.

### Limitations

- **Radio Signal Obstacles:** Performance can diminish if there are significant physical obstructions between the sensor and the LoRa gateway.
- **Battery Dependency:** While battery life is optimized, regular maintenance checks are necessary to ensure timely battery replacements.
- **Water Only Detection:** The sensor is designed specifically for water detection, and may not be accurate in sensing other types of liquids.
- **Environmental Range:** Extreme temperatures or humidity levels outside the specified operating range could potentially affect sensor performance and reliability.

This documentation provides a comprehensive technical overview of the NETVOX - R718Wa, supporting its implementation and ensuring proper understanding of its capabilities and restrictions. This detector forms an integral component of any water management IoT solution by offering timely and reliable water leak alerts.
