## Technical Overview of NETVOX R718Ia2

### Introduction
The NETVOX R718Ia2 is a sophisticated wireless sensor designed to monitor and transmit current data over LoRaWAN networks. It is most commonly used in industrial and commercial settings for applications that require the monitoring of AC current.

### Working Principles
The R718Ia2 operates by using a split-core current transformer to sense AC current. The split-core design allows the sensor to be easily attached to a conductor without interrupting the existing wiring. When current flows through the conductor, it induces a magnetic field in the split-core transformer, which is then transformed into a proportional electrical signal. This signal is digitized and processed by the internal microcontroller of the device, and it can be transmitted over the LoRaWAN network for remote monitoring and analysis.

### Installation Guide
#### Step 1: Determine the Location
- Identify the conductor on which you wish to monitor the AC current.
- Ensure the split-core transformer is compatible with the size of the conductor.

#### Step 2: Attach the Sensor
- Open the split-core transformer by unlatching it.
- Place it around the conductor and securely fasten the latch ensuring proper contact without any air gaps.

#### Step 3: Configure the Sensor
- Use the appropriate NETVOX configuration tool to set the desired parameters such as reporting intervals and thresholds.
  
#### Step 4: Power the Device
- The R718Ia2 operates on 2x 3.6V AA lithium batteries. Insert the batteries ensuring correct polarity.
  
#### Step 5: Connect to the LoRaWAN Network
- Follow network-specific guidelines to connect the sensor to a LoRaWAN gateway, ensuring it is within range.
- Configure the device using an application key and device address provided by your network operator.
