### Technical Overview for ELSYS - Elt Lite (ELSYS)

---

**Introduction:**

The ELSYS Elt Lite is a compact and versatile IoT sensor designed for long-range, low-power applications utilizing LoRaWAN technology. It is highly suitable for various smart applications, including environment monitoring, asset tracking, and facility management, owing to its robust design and reliable performance.

**Working Principles:**

The Elt Lite operates using LoRaWAN technology, which is a Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) specification intended for wireless battery-operated devices. The Elt Lite sends collected sensor data over the LoRaWAN network to be received by gateways, which then forward the data to network servers for processing and analytics. Key to its operation is the efficient use of LoRa modulation to ensure extended range and penetration, even in challenging environments.

**Sensors and Capabilities:**

- **Environmental Monitoring:** Temperature, humidity, and external sensor inputs.
- **Connectivity:** Utilizes LoRa for communication, allowing for extensive transmission reach and low power usage.

**Installation Guide:**

**1. Unboxing and Pre-Installation:**
   - Verify all components are present, including the sensor unit and optional external probes.
   - Check the firmware version and update if necessary using ELSYS software tools.

**2. Configuration:**
   - Connect the device to a computer using a USB Data Cable or configure wirelessly via NFC.
   - Use the ELSYS configuration app for setting up the desired reporting intervals, thresholds, and LoRaWAN parameters (e.g., AppEUI, DevEUI, and AppKey).
   
**3. Physical Installation:**
   - Choose a suitable location, ensuring minimal physical obstructions for optimal signal distribution.
   - Secure the device using screws or mounting tape. For outdoor installation, ensure enclosure sealing to protect against environmental exposure.
   
**4. Network Enrollment:**
   - Register the device on a LoRaWAN network server, assigning necessary security credentials.
   - Initiate a join procedure by powering on the device, ensuring successful network connection.
