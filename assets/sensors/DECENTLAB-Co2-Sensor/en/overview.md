# Technical Overview for DECENTLAB - CO2 Sensor

## Overview

The DECENTLAB CO2 Sensor is a robust, wireless device designed for monitoring carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration in various environments. Utilizing LoRaWAN connectivity, this sensor facilitates long-range and low-power communication, making it ideal for applications requiring scalable and distributed CO2 monitoring solutions.

## Working Principles

The DECENTLAB CO2 Sensor operates based on the Non-Dispersive Infrared (NDIR) principle. NDIR CO2 sensors continuously measure the amount of infrared light absorbed by CO2 molecules, thus determining concentration levels. This technology is known for its accuracy, stability, and longevity, making it suitable for a wide range of environmental conditions.

### Key Components
- **NDIR CO2 Sensor Module**: Provides high accuracy and reliability in CO2 measurement.
- **LoRaWAN Transceiver**: Ensures long-range communication with minimal energy consumption.
- **Embedded Microcontroller**: Manages data processing and communication protocols.
- **Power Supply**: Typically powered by batteries; alternatively, can accommodate solar panels or external power supplies.

## Installation Guide

### Materials Required
- DECENTLAB CO2 Sensor unit
- Mounting hardware (screws, brackets, etc.)
- Power supply (batteries recommended)

### Steps
1. **Location Selection**: Choose an optimal location for sensor installationâ€”preferably at breathing level in indoor environments or at a reasonable height in outdoor applications away from direct sunlight and potential water ingress.
   
2. **Mounting the Sensor**: Secure the sensor using appropriate mounting hardware. Ensure the sensor is positioned correctly for accurate readings.

3. **Powering the Sensor**: Insert the batteries according to the polarity indicated. For continuous operations, ensure battery capacity aligns with expected operational duration.
