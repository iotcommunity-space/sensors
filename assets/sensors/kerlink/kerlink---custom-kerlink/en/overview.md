# KERLINK - Custom Kerlink (KERLINK) Technical Documentation

## Overview

The Custom Kerlink is a versatile and robust IoT device designed manufactured by KERLINK to deliver superb connectivity solutions via the Internet of Things (IoT). The device operates on Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWAN) technology, specifically embedding LoRaWAN, for long-range wireless communication.

## Working Principles

Custom Kerlink primarily operates as a wireless node within a larger network. It uses LoRa modulation technology, which is a specific method for long-range communication that enables vast coverage and capacity for its low power consumption. It strategically spreads information across a wide band of the spectrum, providing excellent interference immunity.

## Installation Guide

1. **Mounting**: Position the Kerlink gateway in the desired location according to specific use case requirements. It should be free from physical obstructions for optimal signal transmission.

2. **Power Supply**: Connect the device to power. Please refer to the manufacturer's manual for specific voltage and power requirements.

3. **Network Configuration**: Using a designated user interface, customize and configure the network settings as per the network provider's instructions. Ensure the device is properly connected to the internet.

## LoRaWAN Details

Low Power Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) is a protocol for low-power, long-range IoT devices. It is designed to wirelessly connect battery operated 'things' to the internet in regional, national or global networks.

The Custom Kerlink utilizes the LoRaWAN protocols to provide robust, end-to-end communications. LoRaWAN also provides varying levels of Quality of Service via different data rates.

## Power Consumption 

Custom Kerlink is designed to consume little power relative to its performance. The power consumption heavily depends on the use case, but on average, it operates efficient power-management modules that lead to greater battery life and reduced electricity costs.

## Use Cases

1. **Smart Agriculture**: Custom Kerlink can monitor environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, soil composition, and light intensity. 

2. **Smart Cities**: Utilized in managing utilities such as electric meters, waste management systems, and monitoring parking spaces. 

3. **Industrial IoT**: The device can monitor industrial equipment efficiency, enabling predictive maintenance and energy efficiency.

## Limitations 

- The maximum data rate and hence bandwidth utilization in LoRaWAN is relatively low, making it unsuitable for high data demanding applications.
- Requires adequate installation locations considering the signal strength and obstructions.
- The LoRaWAN needs a clear line of sight to perform optimally. Physical barriers can limit or obstruct transmission.
  
In conclusion, a Custom Kerlink is an efficient device that promotes a smooth transition to the digital era via IoT technology. It stands as a powerful tool that can equip various sectors, from agriculture to urban settings, with indispensable real-time insights.
