## Technical Overview for STORAGE - Database (STORAGE)

### Introduction
The STORAGE - Database (STORAGE) serves as an integral component for managing and accessing the data collected by IoT sensors in a LoRaWAN network. Its primary role is to store transmitted data efficiently and ensure seamless retrieval for analysis and application purposes.

### Working Principles

#### 1. Data Ingestion
STORAGE receives incoming data packets from LoRaWAN gateways. Data is then processed and stored in structured formats such as tables for relational databases or documents for NoSQL systems.

#### 2. Data Structuring
It applies a schema as per the defined data model, ensuring that metadata and data are correctly mapped to enhance query performance and data integrity.

#### 3. Data Retrieval
STORAGE utilizes query languages like SQL for relational databases or APIs for NoSQL to facilitate data retrieval. It includes indexing mechanisms to optimize query efficiency.

#### 4. Data Security
Encryption mechanisms are implemented both in transit (via TLS/SSL) and at rest. Access controls are enforced to ensure only authorized users can query or manipulate the data.

### Installation Guide

1. **System Requirements:**
   - Minimum 4 CPU cores
   - 8 GB RAM
   - 100 GB SSD storage
   - Network connectivity for LoRaWAN integration

2. **Software Dependencies:**
   - Operating System: Linux-based (Ubuntu or CentOS preferred)
   - Database Engine: MySQL/PostgreSQL for relational, MongoDB/Cassandra for NoSQL

3. **Installation Steps:**
   - **Relational Database:**
     - Install MySQL or PostgreSQL via package manager: `sudo apt-get install mysql-server` or `sudo apt-get install postgresql`
     - Configure the database with necessary users and permissions.
     - Start the service and enable it to run on boot.

   - **NoSQL Database:**
     - Install MongoDB via package manager: `sudo apt-get install -y mongodb`
     - Configure network binding and database path.
     - Enable and start the service.

4. **Configuration:**
   - Set up database schemas aligned with sensor data structures.
   - Integrate the LoRaWAN network server to direct data flow into STORAGE.
   - Enable backups and establish monitoring for performance and health checks.

### LoRaWAN Details

- **Network Integration:**
  - Works in collaboration with LoRaWAN gateways which forward data packets to STORAGE.
  - Utilizes network servers, such as ChirpStack, to manage the routing and processing of messages to STORAGE for ingestion.

- **Uplink Data Processing:**
  - Receives decrypted sensor data after it has been processed through the LoRaWAN server layer.
  - Ensures consistency and low-latency processing for high throughput environments.

### Power Consumption

STORAGE typically runs on modern server hardware or virtualized cloud platforms. Direct power consumption pertains to hardware specs, but operational efficiency relies on database optimization techniques, such as:
- Efficient indexing and query plans
- Scheduled maintenance tasks
- Resource allocation tuning for load balancing

### Use Cases

- **Environmental Monitoring:**
  Used to store data from environmental sensors for real-time analysis and historical trends.
  
- **Smart Agriculture:**
  Manages data from field sensors to optimize watering, pest control, and crop harvesting based on sensor feedback.

- **Urban Infrastructure:**
  Stores telemetry data from urban IoT devices to facilitate smart city applications like traffic management or waste collection.

### Limitations

- **Scalability Constraints:**
  Potential performance reduction with high-velocity data without proper scaling strategies or decentralization approaches.

- **Data Synchronization:**
  Challenges in maintaining data synchronization across distributed systems in geographically dispersed locations.

- **Technical Complexity:**
  Requires specialized skills for setup, maintenance, and optimization, making it less accessible for smaller operations without dedicated IT resources.

This technical overview provides a foundational understanding of the STORAGE database within the context of IoT and LoRaWAN networks. Users should tailor installation and configuration based on specific network and application needs to fully leverage the capabilities of STORAGE.
