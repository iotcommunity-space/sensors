**Technical Overview for SENET - Custom Senet (SENET)**

**A. Working Principles**

SENET is a highly resourceful IoT sensor networking solution that is designed to provide extensive coverage for communication among different devices such as sensors and gateways in a vast IoT network. It harnesses LoRaWAN (Long-Range Wide Area Network) technology to provide low power, secure, bidirectional communication in a scalable, flexible and cost-effective manner. It leverages the already existent public network and also incorporates the ability to deploy private network sensors depending on the client’s specifications.

The central working principle of SENET involves gathering data from connected devices, the data is then communicated to application servers using its gateways. Subsequently, the application servers decipher this data and render it actionable, triggering the appropriate event or response.

**B. Installation Guide**

Installation of the SENET solution requires a fundamental understanding of IoT devices, network management and the LoRaWAN protocol. 

1. Install the LoRaWAN Gateway sensors: Deploy these sensors strategically across your field of operation to ensure proper coverage.
2. Set up the Network Server: This server manages the network’s operations and workload. It should be noted that the server should be in an adequately secured environment.
3. Integrate Application Server: This is effectively the 'brain' of the operation as it processes the data collected and triggers the appropriate response on the devices.
4. Connect devices: Once every other component is correctly installed, you can proceed to connect your network's devices to the SENET enabled LoRaWAN.

**C. LoRaWAN Details**

LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) is a protocol designed for wireless battery-operated devices in a regional, national or global network. SENET is designed to support LoRaWAN, providing benefits such as long-range coverage, low power consumption, and secure data transmission. 

**D. Power Consumption**

SENET devices, being built on LoRaWAN technology, are designed for low power consumption without affecting their long-range telemetry. This makes them ideal for applications where power sources might not be readily available.

**E. Use Cases**

SENET has found applications in various fields such as:

1. Agriculture: It assists in retaining soil moisture data, pesticide usage, and crop health among others.
2. Smart Cities: Monitoring air quality, traffic flow and rubbish bin fill levels.
3. Asset Monitoring: Keeping track of the location and condition of mobile and fixed assets.
4. Industrial IoT: Can supervise machine performance and energy consumption.

**F. Limitations**

1. Bandwidth: SENET being a Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN), it has lower data rates compared to other connection methods like Wi-Fi and Ethernet. Hence, it’s not suitable for applications requiring high data rates.
2. Latency: SENET is not designed for applications requiring real-time responses as there may be some latency in message transmission and reception.
3. Range: Though LoRaWAN has an impressive range, obstruction like trees and buildings can hinder its performance.
