## Technical Overview of SENSATIVE - Multi Sensor +Drip

### Working Principles

The SENSATIVE Multi Sensor +Drip is an advanced IoT device designed to monitor environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, and potential water leaks, using highly sensitive detection mechanisms integrated within a compact design. The sensor is equipped with multiple sensing elements:

- **Temperature and Humidity Sensor**: Utilizes a digital combined sensor module to provide accurate readings of ambient environmental conditions. The sensor relies on a capacitive humidity sensor and a thermistor-based temperature sensor for reliable data capture.

- **Water Leak Detection**: Features a pair of conductive probes that, when in contact with water, close a circuit, thus alerting the system of a leak. This functionality is crucial for preventing water damage and preserving asset integrity in monitored areas.

- **LoRaWAN Communication**: The device communicates with a LoRaWAN network, a low-power wide-area network protocol specifically designed for secure, bi-directional communication at long ranges. It allows the sensor to transmit data over significant distances, enabling deployment in remote or infrastructural environments.

### Installation Guide

1. **Unboxing and Setup**:
   - Carefully unpack the sensor and ensure all components are present.
   - Read the instruction manual to familiarize yourself with safety and operational guidelines.

2. **Choosing Installation Location**:
   - Select a location within 10mm of a potential leak source (e.g., under sinks, near washing machines) for the drip sensor.
   - Ensure the temperature and humidity sensor have exposure to ambient air for accurate readings.

3. **Mounting**:
   - Use the adhesive or mounting screws provided to securely install the sensor in the chosen location.
   - Ensure the sensor is positioned with its probes touching surfaces where water could pool for effective leak detection.

4. **Activation**:
   - Activate the sensor by triggering the onboard switch or removing the battery protective strip, if applicable.
   - Verify operation by conducting a test with each sensing function.

5. **Connectivity**:
   - Configure the sensor to connect with your LoRaWAN gateway by setting the appropriate device identifiers and network keys through the provided network interface.

6. **Maintenance**:
   - Regularly inspect the sensor for physical damage or battery status (as applicable depending on model).
   - Re-calibrate periodically following manufacturer guidelines to ensure accurate measurements.

### LoRaWAN Details

- **Frequency Bands**: The sensor supports multiple regions with varying frequency capabilities (e.g., EU868, US915), ensuring compatibility with local LoRaWAN requirements.
- **Network Capacity**: Capable of operating in dense environments without significant interference due to the adaptive data rate and channel selection.
- **Security**: Employs AES-128 encryption for data security during transmission, ensuring that information is protected against unauthorized access.
  
### Power Consumption

The SENSATIVE Multi Sensor +Drip is engineered for low power consumption, leveraging LoRaWAN's energy-efficient protocols to maximize battery life. Typical power consumption details are as follows:

- **Operating mode**: Less than 50 Î¼A in idle state and approximately 20 mA when transmitting.
- **Battery life**: Depending on sensor reporting frequency and environment, the lifespan can exceed 10 years due to its optimized power management system.

### Use Cases

- **Home Automation**: Automated water monitoring in residential settings to prevent flood damage.
- **Commercial Facilities**: Environmental monitoring in commercial buildings, server rooms, or data centers for climate control and infrastructure protection.
- **Industrial Applications**: Integration within industrial systems for safety and maintenance operations, particularly in unmanned or remote locations.
- **Agriculture**: Monitoring humidity and temperature in greenhouses and storage areas.

### Limitations

- **Signal Range Limit**: While LoRaWAN provides long-range capabilities, physical obstacles and environmental factors may affect communication quality and range.
- **Environmental Constraints**: Extreme temperatures or exposure to corrosive materials may affect sensor performance and longevity.
- **Setup Complexity for Beginners**: Requires familiarity with IoT technologies and network setups, which could be a learning curve for non-technical users.

The SENSATIVE Multi Sensor +Drip stands as a reliable addition to smart ecosystem deployments, offering unparalleled accuracy and comprehensive environmental monitoring to maintain optimal conditions and preemptively address potential issues.
