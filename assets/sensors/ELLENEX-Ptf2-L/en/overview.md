### Technical Overview for ELLENEX - Ptf2 L

The ELLENEX Ptf2 L is an advanced IoT pressure and temperature sensor designed to facilitate accurate and reliable measurements in diverse environmental conditions. This LoRaWAN-enabled device is adept for use in industrial applications where remote monitoring is crucial.

#### Working Principles

The Ptf2 L operates by leveraging a piezoresistive sensor for pressure measurement and a thermistor for temperature sensing. The piezoresistive element changes its resistance in response to applied pressure, and the onboard microcontroller translates this resistance change into an electrical signal representing the pressure value. For temperature sensing, the thermistor alters its resistance with temperature fluctuations; this data is similarly processed into a temperature reading. These sensors are coupled with a precise analog-to-digital converter to ensure accurate digital interpretation.

#### Installation Guide

1. **Site Selection**
   - Choose a location that is representative of the environment needing monitoring. Ensure minimal interference from external factors such as vibrations or extreme conditions beyond sensor specification limits.

2. **Physical Mounting**
   - Ensure the device is securely mounted using brackets or flanges as per the piping or surface setup to prevent physical damage.

3. **Connection Interfaces**
   - The Ptf2 L is equipped with appropriate threaded ports for connecting to pipelines or tanks. Follow the specified torque requirements to avoid sensor damage.

4. **Activation and Calibration**
   - Once installed, power the device and perform zero-point calibration for accurate initial readings. Calibration instructions are provided in the user manual tailored to specific deployment environments.

5. **LoRaWAN Configuration**
   - Integrate the sensor into your LoRaWAN network using specific device credentials. Configure the frequency channels and spread factor settings that align with your regional guidelines.

#### LoRaWAN Details

- **Frequency Bands**: The Ptf2 L supports multiple regional frequency bands, accommodating both EU868 and US915 spectrum allocations.
- **Data Rate**: Adjustable data rates via the Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) feature, optimizing network performance and power consumption.
- **Network Security**: Implements AES-128 encryption for secure transmission across the LoRa network.
- **Range**: Depending on environmental factors, the device can communicate over several kilometers, typically achieving 5-15 km in rural areas and 1-3 km in urban settings.

#### Power Consumption

The Ptf2 L is powered by a long-life lithium battery, ensuring extended operational life with minimal maintenance. In standby mode, the device draws less than 5µA, increasing up to 20mA during data transmission. The sensor is optimized for low power consumption, relying on duty cycling and deep sleep modes to prolong battery life, which can last up to 5 years depending on transmission intervals and environmental conditions.

#### Use Cases

- **Water Resource Management**: Ideal for monitoring pressure and temperature in pipelines and reservoirs to optimize water distribution systems.
- **Industrial Processes**: Useful in factories for pressure management in compressed air systems and temperature monitoring in various industrial processes.
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Suitable for remote monitoring stations that track environmental conditions like groundwater pressure and temperature changes.

#### Limitations

- **Environmental Conditions**: While ruggedized, extreme temperatures beyond the specified operational range (-20°C to 70°C) can affect sensor accuracy and lifespan.
- **Precision Limit**: For highly critical applications requiring sub-1% accuracy, external calibration devices may be necessary for optimal performance.
- **Obstructions in Dense Urban Environments**: The effective range can be significantly reduced due to signal interference or obstruction, necessitating strategic placement for reliable data transmission.

The ELLENEX Ptf2 L represents a robust solution for remote sensor monitoring, offering precise readings with minimal energy use, making it a valuable asset for various industrial applications.
