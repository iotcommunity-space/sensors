## Technical Overview of POLYSENSE - Microwave Radar Sensor

### Working Principles

The POLYSENSE Microwave Radar Sensor utilizes Doppler radar technology to detect motion and interpret various environmental parameters. It operates on the principle of emitting microwave signals in the high-frequency range and analyzing the reflections received back from objects. As objects move within the sensor's detection range, changes in the reflected wave's frequency (due to the Doppler effect) are detected and processed to determine the presence and velocity of objects. This allows for reliable human or vehicle movement detection even in challenging environmental conditions like darkness, fog, or inclement weather.

### Installation Guide

1. **Site Survey**: Conduct a thorough site survey to ensure optimal placement of the sensor. Consider factors such as the typical range and field of view required, potential obstructions, and sources of interference (e.g., large metal objects).

2. **Mounting**: Securely mount the sensor at a height that allows unobstructed coverage of the desired detection area. Typically, this is about 2-3 meters above ground for general motion detection.

3. **Orientation**: Adjust the angle of the sensor to maximize its coverage and sensitivity for the designated zone. Ensure that the radar beam does not point toward common interference sources or unintended areas.

4. **Connectivity**: Establish the sensor’s connection with the LoRaWAN gateway. Ensure that it is within sufficient range to maintain strong signal quality.

5. **Configuration**: Utilize the manufacturer’s provided software or mobile app to configure the detection parameters specific to your application, including sensitivity, detection range, and reporting intervals.

6. **Testing**: Conduct testing to verify that the sensor detects motion as expected and that reported data is accurately relayed to your network.

### LoRaWAN Details

The POLYSENSE Microwave Radar Sensor integrates seamlessly with LoRaWAN networks, enabling long-range, low-power data communication. Key features include:

- **Frequency Bands**: Supports global ISM bands (e.g., EU868, US915) for flexible deployment across various regions.
- **Adaptive Data Rate (ADR)**: Utilizes LoRaWAN's ADR mechanism to dynamically adjust data rates, improving energy efficiency and communication range.
- **Payload**: Encodes detection events and status information in compact payloads for transmission, typically including timestamp and motion status.
- **Security**: Features end-to-end AES-128 encryption to ensure data integrity and confidentiality.

### Power Consumption

The radar sensor is designed for low power consumption, making it suitable for remote and battery-powered applications. It typically operates with:

- **Sleep Mode**: Consumes minimal power (a few microamperes) when no motion is detected, extending battery life up to several years depending on usage patterns.
- **Active Mode**: Power draw increases moderately when motion is detected and data is transmitted.
- **Battery Options**: Supports lithium-thionyl chloride batteries or can be connected to external power sources for continuous operation.

### Use Cases

The versatility of the POLYSENSE Microwave Radar Sensor makes it suitable for a variety of applications, such as:

- **Security and Surveillance**: For monitoring and detecting unauthorized movement in secured areas.
- **Traffic Monitoring**: Used in traffic management systems to detect vehicle speed and presence.
- **Smart Lighting**: Integrated with lighting systems to automate light activation based on motion detection.
- **People Counting**: In retail or public spaces, to monitor foot traffic and optimize operations.

### Limitations

Despite its robust capabilities, the POLYSENSE Microwave Radar Sensor has some limitations:

- **Interference**: Performance may degrade in environments with dense obstructions or where reflections can cause false readings.
- **Weather Conditions**: Although generally robust, extremely severe weather conditions might impact detection accuracy.
- **Installation Height**: Needs optimal placement; too high or too low mounting could affect the detection area coverage.
- **Power Supply Limitations**: In battery-only use, frequent detections may reduce the overall battery life.

Overall, the POLYSENSE Microwave Radar Sensor provides a reliable solution for diverse applications requiring motion detection and environmental monitoring, equipped with advanced features and integrated LoRaWAN connectivity. Proper installation and configuration are crucial to leveraging its full potential effectively.
