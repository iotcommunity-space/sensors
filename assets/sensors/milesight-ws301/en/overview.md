# Technical Overview of MILESIGHT - WS301

## Introduction

The MILESIGHT WS301 is a robust and reliable LoRaWAN-based magnetic contact sensor designed for indoor applications such as door and window monitoring. It is an integral component of smart building systems, security applications, and other IoT-based solutions that require reliable real-time status monitoring of physical entry points.

## Working Principles

The WS301 operates on the basic principle of magnetic contact sensing. It consists of two main parts: a sensor unit and a magnet. The sensor is installed on the fixed part of a doorway or window frame, while the magnet is placed on the moving part (the door or window itself). When the two are aligned, the magnetic field keeps the circuit closed, indicating a closed state. Any displacement that creates a gap between these two components disrupts the magnetic field, prompting the sensor to relay an "open" status through LoRaWAN communication to a central gateway. 

## Installation Guide

1. **Preparation**: Identify the door or window to be monitored. Clean and dry the surface areas where the sensor and magnet will be installed.

2. **Placement**: Attach the sensor unit to the stationary frame using the adhesive backing or screws provided. Align the magnet on the door or window such that, when closed, the magnet and sensor are nearly flush and their arrows point to each other.

3. **Setup via Mobile App**: Install the associated mobile application or access the web interface where the sensor configuration can be completed. Pair the WS301 with the LoRaWAN network according to the on-screen instructions and enter the unique device information such as DevEUI and AppKey.

4. **Testing**: Once installation is complete, close and open the door or window to ensure the sensor correctly detects the states and transmits data to the server.

## LoRaWAN Details

The WS301 is designed to operate on the LoRaWAN protocol, which it utilizes for long-range, low-power wireless communication. It supports:

- **Frequency Bands**: EU868, US915, AU915, AS923 and CN470, conforming to regional regulations.
- **Device Classes**: Class A, ensuring low power consumption.
- **Data Transmission**: Periodic status updates, along with event-triggered messages in case of open/close events.
  
The WS301 requires connection to a LoRaWAN gateway for Internet access, enabling remote monitoring and management. Networking parameters such as DevEUI, AppEUI, and AppKey are used for device authentication.

## Power Consumption

The WS301 is powered by a replaceable CR14505 lithium battery, designed for long-term use without frequent replacements. The expected battery life is up to 5 years under typical conditions, varying based on frequency of transmissions and environmental factors. Power-saving features include adaptive data rate (ADR) for optimal balance between range and energy efficiency.

## Use Cases

- **Security Systems**: Integration into home and commercial security systems for unauthorized entry detection.
- **Occupancy Monitoring**: In smart buildings to track room usage and adjust HVAC systems accordingly.
- **Asset Management**: Monitoring display cabinets or storage units to detect unauthorized access.
- **Facility Management**: Automated logging of door and window usage in facilities for occupancy and access analytics.

## Limitations

- **Metal Interference**: Performance can be affected by installation on ferrous metal surfaces due to magnetic interference; care must be taken to ensure accurate alignment and testing.
- **Range Dependency**: The effective range of LoRaWAN is influenced by environmental factors such as obstructions and building materials, requiring careful placement of gateways to ensure coverage.
- **Battery Replacement**: Although infrequent, replacement involves accessing the installed unit, necessitating easy mounting access.
- **Data Transmission Delay**: As a Class A device, message transmission is not instantaneous and might experience slight delays in high traffic networks.

In summary, the MILESIGHT WS301 offers a reliable solution for a variety of smart monitoring applications utilizing efficient LoRaWAN technology, with considerations for installation environment and network setup enabling optimal performance.
