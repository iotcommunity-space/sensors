### Working Principles

The Ct305 and Ct310 sensors operate by measuring various environmental parameters. They use a combination of built-in actuators and transducers to accurately capture data, which is then transmitted over LoRaWAN, a low-power wide-area networking protocol optimized for battery-powered devices in IoT applications. The Ct sensors employ the latest sensor fusion technologies to ensure data accuracy and reliability.

1. **Data Acquisition:** Both models gather data through integrated microcontrollers that process input from connected environmental probes.
2. **Signal Processing:** The raw signals are then converted into digital data using a high-precision analog-to-digital converter.
3. **Data Transmission:** Utilizing LoRaWAN’s adaptive data rate capabilities, the sensors transmit data to a gateway, which then forwards it to a cloud platform where it can be accessed for analysis.

### Installation Guide

**Step 1: Location Selection**
- Choose a location with minimal obstructions and interference for optimal data transmission.
- Ensure the installation site provides appropriate exposure to the environmental conditions intended for monitoring.

**Step 2: Mounting**
- Secure the sensor using the provided mounting bracket. Ensure that the sensor is level and firmly attached to avoid false readings resulting from movement.

**Step 3: Power Connection**
- The Ct305 and Ct310 models are battery-operated. Install the batteries as per the instructions in the user manual. For backup power, ensure connectivity to an auxiliary power source if available.

**Step 4: Device Activation**
- Activate the device by pressing the power button until the LED indicator shows a stable light, signifying successful power-up.

**Step 5: Configuration**
- Use the accompanying mobile application or web interface to configure device settings, including network parameters, data transmission intervals, and thresholds for alerts.

**Step 6: Network Integration**
- Join the sensor to your LoRaWAN network by inputting the device’s unique identifiers (DevEUI, AppEUI, and AppKey) into your network server.
