### Technical Overview: WATTECO Smart Plug

The WATTECO Smart Plug is a cutting-edge IoT device designed to facilitate energy monitoring and control in residential, commercial, and industrial environments. By integrating with LoRaWAN networks, it enables users to remotely manage connected devices and monitor energy consumption, bringing efficiency and convenience to power management.

#### Working Principles

The WATTECO Smart Plug operates by connecting electrical devices to a standard electrical outlet, allowing it to monitor the energy consumption and control the power supply. It uses internal sensors to detect current and voltage, calculating real-time power usage and transmitting this data over LoRaWAN. The smart plug can switch devices on or off via remote commands through a cloud-based interface or mobile app. 

It is designed to work with AC power supply typically used in household and office environments, converts the AC voltage into a suitable measurement for its internal electronics, extracts relevant energy consumption statistics, and controls the connected device according to user-set parameters.

#### Installation Guide

1. **Preparation**: 
   - Ensure the Smart Plug is compatible with the local electrical standards.
   - Download and install the associated mobile application or ensure access to the web portal provided by WATTECO.

2. **Physical Installation**:
   - Plug the WATTECO Smart Plug into a standard wall socket.
   - Connect the desired electrical device to the Smart Plug’s socket.
   - Make sure the device’s total power does not exceed the maximum rating of the Smart Plug.

3. **Network Setup**:
   - Ensure you have an operative LoRaWAN network with access keys (AppEUI, DevEUI, and AppKey).
   - Using the app or portal, register the device using the unique identifiers found on the Smart Plug.
   - Finalize the onboarding process by following the instructions prompted by the application, typically involving scanning a QR code or manually entering the IDs.

4. **Configuration**:
   - Set up notification preferences for energy consumption, power anomalies, or device statuses.
   - Configure scheduled on/off times or energy thresholds as needed.

#### LoRaWAN Details

- **Frequency Band**: Operates within the ISM frequency bands (such as EU868, US915) subject to regional regulations.
- **Data Rate**: Uses ADR (Adaptive Data Rate) to optimize data transmission speed and battery usage.
- **Security**: Employs AES-128 encryption to secure data transmitted over the network.
- **Network Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with existing LoRaWAN networks, allowing for scalable deployment across multiple locations.

#### Power Consumption

The WATTECO Smart Plug is designed with energy efficiency in mind. It consumes minimal power while idle and has optimized power characteristics during active transmission to balance energy monitoring and device control functions effectively. Typically, it draws less than 0.5 Watts when in standby mode.

#### Use Cases

- **Residential Energy Management**: Monitor and manage the power usage of household appliances, reduce energy bills, and optimize energy consumption patterns.
- **Commercial Applications**: Implement energy-saving strategies in offices, retail, and other commercial spaces by controlling lighting, HVAC systems, and other electrical appliances.
- **Industrial Monitoring**: Track and limit the power consumption of non-critical machinery to improve energy efficiency and machinery uptime.
- **Remote Control**: Utilize scheduling and remote control features to turn devices on/off without physical presence, enhancing security and convenience.

#### Limitations

- **Network Dependence**: Requires a reliable LoRaWAN network infrastructure for optimal functionality and real-time data transmission.
- **Data Transmission Limits**: Subject to inherent LoRaWAN limitations regarding data packet size and frequency, which may impact usage scenarios that demand fast or voluminous data transfers.
- **Environmental Constraints**: Designed mostly for indoor use, performance can be affected by extreme temperatures or high humidity environments.
- **Device Compatibility**: The Smart Plug’s maximum power rating might limit its use with certain high-wattage appliances or industrial equipment.

The WATTECO Smart Plug provides a robust solution for those looking to gain visibility into their energy consumption patterns while offering control over connected devices through an advanced IoT platform backed by LoRaWAN technology.
