### Technical Overview for POLYSENSE - Limit Switch Sensor

#### Working Principles

The POLYSENSE Limit Switch Sensor is designed to detect the presence or absence of objects or to monitor mechanical positions. This sensor incorporates a limit switch, which is an electromechanical device operated by a physical force applied to a mobile actuator. When the actuator is moved by an object, it triggers an electrical switch that sends a signal to a connected monitoring system.

The sensor integrates with LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) technology to facilitate wireless transmission of the collected data to the cloud platform. This capability allows for real-time monitoring and analysis without the constraints of wired connectivity.

#### Installation Guide

1. **Location Preparation**: Choose a suitable location where the sensor can easily interact with the moving part of the machine or object to be monitored. Ensure that the environmental conditions (temperature, humidity) are within the sensor's operational range.

2. **Mounting**: Secure the sensor using the provided screws or mounting brackets. It should be mounted stably to avoid any movement that could lead to false triggers.

3. **Wiring**: Connect the actuator to the mechanical part whose limit needs to be monitored. For powered versions, connect the sensor to a compatible power source.

4. **Configuration**: Use the provided setup tool or software to configure the LoRaWAN parameters (such as DevEUI, AppEUI, and AppKey) and frequency settings according to regional regulations.

#### LoRaWAN Details

- **Frequency Bands**: The sensor supports various LoRaWAN frequency bands, including EU433, EU868, US915, and AS923, among others. Adjust the frequency programmatically if necessary.
- **Activation**: Supports both Over-the-Air Activation (OTAA) and Activation by Personalization (ABP) methods.
- **Data Rate**: Supports adaptive data rate to optimize communication range and battery life.
- **Encryption**: All data sent is encrypted using AES-128 encryption to ensure security and integrity during transmission.

#### Power Consumption

The sensor is designed for low power consumption, crucial for IoT deployments. Power efficiency is achieved through mechanisms such as:

- **Sleep Mode**: When not in operation, the sensor enters sleep mode to minimize energy usage.
- **Transmission Scheduling**: Usage of transmission intervals can be configured to balance between battery life and data reporting frequency.
- **Battery Type**: The sensor may draw power from standard batteries; check specifications for battery life expectancy under typical use-case scenarios.

#### Use Cases

- **Industrial Automation**: Installed on assembly lines for monitoring the position of mechanical arms or components.
- **Building Management**: Ensuring doors, gates, or windows are in the desired open/closed state.
- **Logistics**: Monitoring the position of containers or goods in transit to ensure they remain secure.
- **Safety Systems**: Used in safety interlock systems to ensure machinery is aligned correctly before operation.

#### Limitations

- **Range**: Reliance on LoRaWAN means functionality is dependent on network coverage. Poor coverage areas might require additional gateways.
- **Environmental Constraints**: Extreme temperatures or moisture can affect sensor performance.
- **Mechanical Wear and Tear**: As a mechanical device, the actuator or switching mechanism may wear out over time requiring maintenance or replacement.
- **Interference**: Like all wireless devices, it may suffer from interference from other wireless systems in the vicinity, potentially affecting communication reliability.

The POLYSENSE Limit Switch Sensor is a valuable component for IoT applications, offering robust monitoring capabilities with the flexibility of wireless communication. However, integration planning should account for its operational constraints to optimize longevity and performance.
