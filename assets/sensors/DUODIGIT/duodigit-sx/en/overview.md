### Data Transmission
The sensor uses LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) technology for wireless communication. LoRa modulation allows for low power consumption and extended connectivity ranges up to several kilometers, depending on environmental conditions and network configurations.

### Measurement Capabilities
DUODIGIT - Sx can be tailored for various sensing needs, including but not limited to:

- Temperature: Using precision thermistors or RTDs.
- Humidity: Capacitive or resistive hygrometric sensors.
- Soil Moisture: Capacitive moisture sensors for agricultural applications.

## Installation Guide

### Pre-Installation Checklist
- Verify network compatibility for LoRaWAN infrastructure.
- Ensure the sensor meets environmental and operational requirements for the site.
- Gather tools for mounting and weatherproofing, if necessary.

### Installation Steps
1. **Site Selection**: Choose an optimal location that facilitates proper sensor function and access to LoRaWAN nodes.
2. **Mounting**: Securely mount the sensor unit using provided brackets or screws. Ensure it is correctly positioned to capture representative data for the parameters being monitored.
3. **Power Connection**: Insert the appropriate battery or connect to a power source following the inbuilt connectors' guide. Ensure the power source is stable and adequate for the sensor's requirements.
4. **Configuration**: Utilize the accompanying configuration software (or app) to setup the sensor:
   - Enter network credentials for LoRaWAN.
   - Calibrate sensors if necessary.
5. **Testing**: Perform a functional test to ensure data is correctly captured and transmitted to the cloud or server.

## LoRaWAN Details

### Network Protocol
- **Frequency Bands**: Compatible with LoRaWAN regional frequencies (e.g., EU868, US915).
- **Network Security**: Implements AES-128 encryption for payload data.
- **Device Activation**: Supports both Over-the-Air Activation (OTAA) and Activation by Personalization (ABP).

### Data Transmission
- Transmission intervals are configurable from 1 minute to several hours, depending on application requirements and power considerations.
- Uplink and downlink message configurations ensure bi-directional communication when required.

## Power Consumption

### Power Options
DUODIGIT - Sx offers flexible power options, including:
- **Battery Operation**: Compatible with standard lithium-Ion, Li-SOCl2 batteries.
- **External Power Supply**: Optional for installations requiring constant power.

### Consumption Metrics
- **Sleep Mode**: <5ÂµA
- **Active Mode**: Consumption varies based on data transmission intervals, but typically around 30mA during transmission.
  
The sensor is designed to optimize power consumption using duty-cycling techniques, allowing for battery longevity of up to several years, depending on configuration and usage patterns.

## Use Cases

1. **Environmental Monitoring**: Collects data for parameters like air quality, temperature, and humidity in urban monitoring systems.
2. **Smart Agriculture**: Monitors soil moisture, temperature, and environmental parameters to enhance crop management.
3. **Industrial Automation**: Provides real-time monitoring of conditions such as warehouse temperature and humidity, important for maintaining stock integrity.

## Limitations

- **Line-of-Sight Requirement**: For optimal performance, especially over long distances, line-of-sight to LoRa gateways is recommended.
- **Limited Bandwidth**: LoRaWAN is designed for low-bandwidth applications; thus, it is not suited for high-frequency data transmission.
- **Data Latency**: Network-induced latency may not be suitable for real-time applications requiring instant feedback.
- **Environmental Conditions**: Extreme weather conditions or obstructions may impact performance and sensor readings.

The DUODIGIT - Sx exemplifies a robust solution for IoT sensing environments where power efficiency and long-range communication are priorities.
