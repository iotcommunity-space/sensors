## MCF - Lw12Ter (MCF) Technical Overview

**Working Principle**

The MCF - Lw12Ter works based on the principle of the Internet of Things (IoT). This device captures and transmits data over an established network. It uses various sensors to record parameters like temperature, light intensity, humidity or others depending on its programming and intended usage. 

Through low power wireless LoRaWAN communication protocol, it can connect to a wide area network that provides the platform for sending accumulated data to a centralized server for analytics and forecasting.

**Installation Guide**

- Step 1: Unpack the device from the box
- Step 2: Install the required antennas or sensors as per the device requirements
- Step 3: Power ON the device, it will automatically initialize itself for first time usage
- Step 4: Now, itâ€™s time to pair the device with the LoRaWAN network. This can be achieved by entering the network credentials (Network ID, Network Key) into the device.
- Step 5: Once the network is live, the device starts transmitting the sensor data to your configured server location.

**LoRaWAN Details**

LoRaWAN refers to a low-power wide-area networking protocol designed for wireless battery-operated devices in a regional, national, or global network. LoRaWAN offers features including low power consumption, long range connectivity, and secure data transmission. It operates in different frequency bands, including 868 MHz for Europe and 915 MHz for North America.

MCF - Lw12Ter operates on a LoRaWAN network and requires the essential login credentials to connect to this network.

**Power Consumption**

The MCF - Lw12Ter is a low-power device designed to consume minimal power to operate. It can function on a battery for years without requiring any change, depending on the data transmission frequency and amount of data being transmitted.

**Use Cases**

- Industrial Automation: MCF - Lw12Ter could be utilized to regularly monitor environment parameters like temperature or humidity within an industrial environment.
- Home Automation: It could be used in smart homes for energy monitoring and utility management.
- Agriculture: Monitoring of atmospheric condition parameters for making informed decisions on crop management.
- Smart Cities: It can serve the purpose of monitoring various parameters like air quality, noise pollution, etc.

**Limitations**

- Limited Processing: Although it can capture and send data reliably, its processing capabilities are limited as it can't perform complex computations.
- Dependence on Network: The device needs to be within the coverage of the LoRaWAN network. In areas without sufficient coverage, data transmission can prove to be a problem.
- Battery: Although designed for low power consumption, a highly frequent data transmission requirement can drain the battery faster. Battery replacement may be needed in such cases.
- Sensing Limitations: The type and accuracy of parameters it can sense depends on the type of sensors installed. Higher the accuracy requirement, more expensive the sensor becomes.
