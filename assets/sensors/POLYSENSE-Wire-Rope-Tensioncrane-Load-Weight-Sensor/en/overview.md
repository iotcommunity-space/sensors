# POLYSENSE Wire Rope Tension/Crane Load Weight Sensor

## Technical Overview

The POLYSENSE Wire Rope Tension/Crane Load Weight Sensor is a specialized IoT device designed to measure the tension in wire ropes and the load weight of cranes. This sensor is crucial for ensuring the safety and efficiency of lifting operations in various industrial settings. It leverages LoRaWAN technology for remote monitoring and real-time data acquisition.

### Working Principles

The POLYSENSE sensor operates by measuring the tension in a wire rope, which directly correlates to the load weight. The sensor is equipped with strain gauges that detect minute changes in wire rope diameter or elongation as the load changes. This mechanical deformation is translated into an electrical signal using a Wheatstone bridge configuration, enabling precise measurement of the load being carried.

### Installation Guide

1. **Site Assessment**: Begin by assessing the site to determine the optimal location for sensor installation, ensuring it is free from obstacles and has a clear line of sight for radio communication.

2. **Sensor Positioning**: Securely mount the sensor on the wire rope using the provided clamps. Ensure that the sensor is positioned in a straight and untwisted section of the rope for accurate measurements.

3. **Calibration**: Calibrate the sensor according to the manufacturer's guidelines. This typically involves placing known weights and adjusting the sensor settings to ensure accurate data readings.

4. **Connect to Power**: Install the power supply. For battery-powered models, ensure that batteries are fresh and check the power level indicator before use.

5. **Configure LoRaWAN**: Set up the LoRaWAN gateway and configure the sensor to communicate with it. This involves setting the device EUI, AppKey, and AppEUI to establish a secure communication channel.

6. **Testing**: Perform a test lift with known weights to verify the sensor's accuracy and communication integrity.

### LoRaWAN Details

- **Frequency Bands**: The sensor supports multiple frequency bands suitable for LoRaWAN, catering to regional regulatory requirements (such as EU863-870, US902-928).
- **Communication Range**: Offers a range of up to 15 kilometers in open areas, significantly reducing the need for physical presence near the crane.
- **Data Transmission Rate**: Configurable ADR (Adaptive Data Rate) to balance between range, battery life, and data rate.
- **Security**: AES-128 encryption ensuring secure data transfer.

### Power Consumption

- The sensor uses a low-power design to extend battery life, typically achieving several years on a single set of batteries depending on usage frequency and data transmission intervals.
- Power-saving modes may include sleep intervals where the sensor remains inactive and wakes up periodically for measurements and data transmission based on the configuration.

### Use Cases

- **Construction Sites**: Monitoring crane operations to prevent overloading, ensuring compliance with safety regulations.
- **Ports and Dockyards**: Managing cargo operations by measuring load weights efficiently and effectively.
- **Manufacturing Facilities**: Coordinating logistics and handling processes by integrating load monitoring into asset tracking systems.

### Limitations

- **Environmental Conditions**: Harsh environmental conditions like extreme temperatures or corrosive atmospheres may require additional protective measures.
- **Interference**: Physical obstructions or interference from other wireless devices can affect LoRaWAN communication range and reliability.
- **Calibration Sensitivity**: Regular recalibration is necessary to maintain accuracy due to potential changes in rope characteristics or sensor drift over time.
- **Limited Payload**: LoRaWAN's design for low-power, long-range communication inherently limits the payload size and thus the granularity of data transmitted.

The POLYSENSE Wire Rope Tension/Crane Load Weight Sensor is a robust solution designed for enhancing safety and operational efficiency in industries reliant on material handling and lifting. Its integration with LoRaWAN technology ensures it remains flexible and adaptable across various use cases, providing essential data for critical decision-making.
