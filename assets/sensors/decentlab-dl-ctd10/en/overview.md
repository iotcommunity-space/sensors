#### Working Principles
1. **Conductivity Measurement**: The DL-CTD10 utilizes an inductive conductivity sensor that eliminates the fouling risks associated with traditional electrodes. It provides accurate measurements by inducing an electric current in a closed loop of water and measuring its capacitive coupling.

2. **Temperature Measurement**: A high-precision thermistor is incorporated to measure temperature. It provides stability and accuracy vital for correcting conductivity readings to a standard temperature.

3. **Depth Measurement**: The sensor uses a piezoresistive pressure transducer to determine the depth. The pressure is converted into an analog electrical signal, showing the equivalent depth in the water column.

4. **Data Transmission**: Utilizing the LoRaWAN protocol, the DL-CTD10 transmits data over long distances with minimal power consumption, ideal for wide-area monitoring networks.
