## Technical Overview: YUDASH - Https ()

### Introduction
YUDASH - Https () is an advanced IoT sensor system designed for efficient, long-range connectivity using LoRaWAN technology. It is engineered to provide reliable data transmission for various applications through a secure HTTP interface. This overview describes its working principles, installation procedures, connectivity details, power consumption specifications, use cases, and limitations.

### Working Principles

#### Core Functionality
YUDASH operates on the LoRaWAN protocol, leveraging the low-power, wide-area networking capabilities to transmit data over long distances with minimal power consumption. It collects sensor data, processes it, and securely transmits it via HTTP to a designated server or cloud platform.

#### Sensor Integration
The YUDASH system can integrate multiple types of sensors, including temperature, humidity, pressure, and motion detectors. Its modular design allows easy customization and calibration for specific measurement requirements.

#### Data Transmission
Data is transmitted using LoRaWAN, which encodes the sensor readings and sends them over the air. Once data reaches the gateway, it is relayed over the internet using an HTTPS protocol, ensuring secure data transmission.

### Installation Guide

1. **Site Planning:**
   - Assess the coverage requirements and optimal sensor placement.
   - Ensure there is a sufficient line of sight between the device and the LoRaWAN gateway.

2. **Hardware Setup:**
   - Mount the YUDASH unit using the provided brackets or mounting fixtures.
   - Connect the sensor arrays as per the application needs.

3. **Configuration:**
   - Power on the device and access the configuration interface using a web browser or dedicated application.
   - Input the network parameters, such as LoRaWAN session keys and join settings.

4. **Connectivity Test:**
   - Perform a connection test to ensure successful pairing with a local LoRaWAN gateway.
   - Verify data transmission to the server via HTTP.

5. **Finalization:**
   - Secure all connections and mountings.
   - Complete the setup by testing the integrated sensors for accurate readings.

### LoRaWAN Details

- **Frequency Bands:** Compatible with various regional ISM bands such as EU868, US915, AU915, etc.
- **Spreading Factor:** Adaptive data rate (ADR) capability allowing the device to adjust the spreading factor for optimal performance.
- **Security:** Utilizes AES-128 encryption for data security during transmission.

### Power Consumption

YUDASH is designed with ultra-low power modes to extend battery life. Typical power consumption in standby mode is below 10 Î¼A, whereas active transmission consumes around 100 mA. It supports both battery operation and external power supplies for flexibility.

### Use Cases
