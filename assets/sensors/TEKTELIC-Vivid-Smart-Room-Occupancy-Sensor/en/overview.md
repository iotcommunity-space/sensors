# TEKTELIC Vivid Smart Room Occupancy Sensor: Technical Overview

## Introduction
The TEKTELIC Vivid Smart Room Occupancy Sensor is an advanced IoT device designed to monitor room occupancy with high precision. This sensor integrates seamlessly into smart building management systems, offering real-time insights for optimizing energy usage, enhancing security, and improving overall facility management. The device uses a combination of passive infrared (PIR), light, and temperature sensors to accurately detect presence and environmental conditions within a room.

## Working Principles

### Occupancy Detection
- **Passive Infrared Sensor (PIR):** The sensor employs a PIR sensor to detect motion and presence by measuring infrared radiation from moving objects, typically humans. When an object enters the field of view, the change in infrared energy is detected, indicating occupancy.
- **Light and Temperature Measurements:** Additional sensors measure ambient light levels and temperature to provide context to occupancy data and support enhanced energy management strategies.

## Installation Guide

### Pre-Installation Requirements
1. **Location Selection:** Choose a location with a clear line of sight to the area of interest. Ensure there are no large obstructions like furniture or partitions that may block the sensor's view.
2. **Height:** Install at a recommended height of approximately 2.5 to 4 meters for optimal coverage and detection accuracy.

### Installation Steps
1. **Mounting:** Use the mounting bracket supplied with the sensor to securely affix it to a wall or ceiling. Ensure the sensor is firmly in place to prevent any shifts that may affect its readings.
2. **Positioning:** Angle the sensor properly for the intended detection zone. Confirm the device aligns with key areas for reliable detection.
3. **Powering the Device:** The sensor is battery-powered with a long-life lithium battery pack. Ensure the batteries are correctly inserted and fully charged.
4. **Activation:** Once installed, power the device by closing the battery compartment. An LED indicator will briefly blink, confirming activation.

## LoRaWAN Details

### Connectivity
- **Network Compatibility:** Leveraging LoRaWAN connectivity, the Vivid sensor supports seamless integration with existing LoRaWAN networks, providing extensive range and secure data transmission.
- **Frequency Bands:** Compatible with various LoRaWAN frequency bands (e.g., EU868, US915) depending on regional specifications.
- **Data Transmission:** The sensor transmits occupancy, light, and temperature data periodically over the LoRaWAN network. Communication intervals can be configured remotely based on use case requirements.

## Power Consumption

- **Battery Life:** Designed for ultra-low power consumption, the sensor operates for several years on a single set of batteries, typically ranging from 5 to 10 years, depending on transmission frequency and environmental conditions.
- **Conservation Features:** The sensor features adaptive data rate and sleep mode functionalities to minimize energy usage and extend battery life.

## Use Cases

1. **Smart Building Management:** Optimize HVAC and lighting systems based on actual room occupancy to reduce energy waste and costs.
2. **Office Space Utilization:** Monitor usage patterns in office environments to manage space allocation and improve productivity.
3. **Security Monitoring:** Enhance security through real-time occupancy detection in sensitive areas during non-working hours.
4. **Facility Management:** Provide data-driven insights for facility maintenance and occupancy compliance tracking.

## Limitations

- **Line of Sight Requirement:** The effectiveness of PIR detection depends on a clear line of sight. Obstructions may lead to reduced accuracy.
- **Limited Detection Range:** Detection accuracy decreases at greater distances and under extreme temperature variations.
- **Deployment Environment:** Performance may vary based on room size, shape, and the presence of reflective surfaces like glass or mirrors.
- **Non-discriminatory Detection:** The sensor struggles to differentiate between humans and pets, which may lead to unintended triggers in some environments.

Understanding and carefully considering these technical aspects can help maximize the utility and efficiency of the TEKTELIC Vivid Smart Room Occupancy Sensor in diverse environments.
