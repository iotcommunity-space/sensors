### Technical Overview: Custom Orbiwise - ORBIWISE

#### Introduction
Orbiwise is a company renowned for its advanced development and deployment of IoT solutions, known primarily for its competency in custom LoRaWAN network server solutions. The ORBIWISE system is a comprehensive tool designed to manage and optimize IoT operations leveraging LoRaWAN technology.

#### Working Principles
Orbiwise employs the LoRa (Long Range) protocol to facilitate communication between low-power sensors and network servers over large distances. This system is based on the LoRaWAN architecture which is a media access control (MAC) layer protocol designed specifically for wireless battery-operated devices in a regional, national, or global network. The primary components include:

- **Sensors/End Devices**: These are low-power devices that capture and transmit data.
- **Gateways**: They act as bridges between end devices and the central network server.
- **Network Server**: Centralized server that manages data traffic, ensures security, and facilitates device management.
- **Application Server**: Processes the data for end-user applications.

The ORBIWISE platform provides key functionalities like adaptive data rate optimization, seamless device integration, and scalable network management.

#### Installation Guide
1. **Pre-installation Planning**: Assess site requirements for gateway placement, ensuring optimal coverage and minimal physical obstructions. Evaluate network capacity needs based on sensor density and data traffic.
   
2. **Gateway Installation**:
   - Mount the gateway in an elevated outdoor location for maximum coverage.
   - Connect the gateway to a stable power source and secure it against weather exposure.
   - Configure the gateway settings to align with the network server, often involving setting IP addresses and network identifiers.

3. **Network Server Configuration**:
   - Set up the Orbiwise LoRaWAN server with credentials and configure network settings.
   - Add gateway details to the server to begin communication.
   - Verify network integration through diagnostics tools in the Orbiwise WebGUI.

4. **Sensor/End Device Configuration**:
   - Register each sensor with the network, inputting unique identifiers and keys.
   - Install sensors at predefined locations ensuring they are within the gateway's range.
   - Test connectivity and data transmission integrity.

#### LoRaWAN Details
The ORBIWISE utilizes LoRaWAN Class A, B, and C devices, adapting to various IoT application requirements:

- **Class A**: Bi-directional communication where each uplink transmission is followed by two short downlink windows.
- **Class B**: Scheduled bi-directional communications with additional downlink opportunities through beacon synchronization.
- **Class C**: Nearly continuous listening for downlink communication except when transmitting.

This flexibility supports applications from infrequent sensor checks to real-time systems needing constant data flow.

#### Power Consumption
The system is designed for energy efficiency. End devices consume very low power during inactivity. With demand calculus, devices can last several years on a small battery. Power-saving techniques involve:

- Utilizing the sleep mode between transmissions.
- Optimizing data rate to minimize transmission time (ADR - Adaptive Data Rate).

Gateways, however, require more power and typically need a continuous power supply given their constant communication and processing duties.

#### Use Cases

1. **Smart Agriculture**: Monitoring soil moisture and weather conditions, optimizing irrigation.
2. **Smart Cities**: Managing street lighting and waste collection.
3. **Industrial IoT**: Tracking machines' operational status, predictive maintenance.
4. **Logistics and Transport**: Fleet tracking and management through extensive geographical coverage.
  
#### Limitations
Despite its strengths, the ORBIWISE system does have constraints:

- **Limited Bandwidth**: Suitable for low-bandwidth applications, not ideal for high-data-rate needs.
- **Dependency on Infrastructure**: Effective operation contingent on network and gateway setup which can be challenging in rugged terrains.
- **Interference in Densely Populated Areas**: Urban deployments may see signal interference.
- **Regulatory Constraints**: Frequency and transmission limits can vary by region, requiring compliance with local laws.

Through its capabilities, Custom Orbiwise can provide scalable, efficient, and cost-effective IoT network infrastructure solutions suitable for a multitude of applications, albeit with considerations for its constraints and operational environment.
