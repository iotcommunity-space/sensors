### Technical Overview for POLYSENSE - Tilt Sensor

#### 1. Working Principles

The POLYSENSE Tilt Sensor is designed to detect and measure angular displacement and tilt in various axes, providing crucial data for applications where orientation or movement is crucial. Utilizing Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) technology, the sensor detects changes in the capacitance caused by the tilt or angle change around a particular axis. This change is then converted into an electrical signal, which can be integrated into monitoring and control systems.

#### 2. Installation Guide

**Step 1: Site Selection**  
- Choose a location that accurately represents the area of interest. Ensure that the sensor is mounted on a stable surface to avoid mechanical noise or false readings.
  
**Step 2: Mounting the Sensor**  
- Use the provided mounting brackets and screws to secure the sensor. Pay attention to the orientation guidelines, which are crucial for accurate data acquisition.

**Step 3: Calibration**  
- After mounting, the sensor should be calibrated. This involves positioning the sensor in its reference position and following the calibration procedure via the POLYSENSE mobile application or the web interface.

**Step 4: Connecting to Network**  
- Activate the sensor and connect it to a LoRaWAN network. Ensure that the device is within range of a LoRaWAN gateway.

#### 3. LoRaWAN Details

- **Frequency Bands**: The sensor operates on standard LoRaWAN frequency bands, including 433 MHz, 868 MHz (Europe), 915 MHz (North America), and others, dependent on regional regulations.
  
- **Data Transmission**: The POLYSENSE Tilt Sensor is configured to transmit data at scheduled intervals or on significant tilt events, which optimizes network bandwidth and prolongs battery life.

- **Activation Method**: Supports both Over-the-Air Activation (OTAA) and Activation by Personalization (ABP).

#### 4. Power Consumption

The POLYSENSE Tilt Sensor is designed with energy efficiency in mind, making it suitable for long-term deployment in remote locations. Typical power characteristics include:

- **Sleep Mode**: <10 ÂµA
- **Active Mode**: Approximately 10 mA
- **Transmission Mode**: Approximately 40 mA when transmitting data

The sensor is powered by a replaceable lithium battery, providing up to 10 years of operation, depending on data transmission frequency and environment.

#### 5. Use Cases

- **Structural Health Monitoring**: Ideal for bridges, buildings, and dams, providing real-time data on structural shifts or tilts.
  
- **Landslide and Slope Monitoring**: Used to monitor soil movement and potential landslides in hilly or mountainous regions.

- **Machinery and Equipment Monitoring**: Helps in ensuring that industrial equipment is correctly aligned and operating within safe tilt parameters.

- **Transportation Safety**: Monitors tilt in vehicles to prevent rollovers or tilts due to loading issues.

#### 6. Limitations

- **Environmental Conditions**: Extreme temperatures and humidity can affect sensor readings and battery performance. Therefore, it is not recommended for harsh environments without proper housing.

- **Installation Sensitivity**: Misalignment during installation can lead to inaccurate data, necessitating careful calibration and alignment.

- **Line of Sight for Network**: Requires appropriate placement to ensure connectivity with LoRaWAN gateways, which may be a challenge in dense urban or remote areas.

- **Limited Granularity**: The granularity of tilt detection may not be suitable for applications requiring high precision measurements.

This technical overview provides essential information needed to effectively deploy and utilize the POLYSENSE Tilt Sensor in various applications, maximizing its potential while mitigating its limitations.
