## Technical Overview: POLYSENSE Leak Monitoring Sensor

### Introduction

The POLYSENSE Leak Monitoring Sensor is a state-of-the-art IoT device designed to detect and monitor leaks in industrial, commercial, and residential settings. Utilizing advanced sensor technology and LoRaWAN connectivity, this sensor provides real-time leak detection with minimal power consumption.

### Working Principles

The POLYSENSE Leak Monitoring Sensor operates using capacitive or resistive sensing to detect the presence of liquids. These sensor types are known for their high sensitivity and accuracy in detecting even minute changes in moisture. Upon detecting a leak, the sensor triggers an alert which is transmitted over the LoRaWAN network for immediate response.

- **Capacitive Sensing**: Uses two electrodes to measure changes in capacitance caused by the presence of liquid, ideal for non-conductive fluids.
- **Resistive Sensing**: Utilizes a pair of conductive probes to measure changes in resistance when a conductive liquid bridges the gap between them.

### Installation Guide

1. **Location Selection**: Identify areas prone to leaks, such as under sinks, along water lines, or near HVAC systems.
2. **Mounting**: Use the provided adhesive strips or mounting brackets to secure the sensor in the selected location. Ensure that the sensor probes are in direct contact with the surface.
3. **Orientation**: Position the sensor in such a way that its detection plane is parallel to potential leak sources.
4. **Network Integration**: Register the sensor's unique ID with the LoRaWAN network through the network server interface.
5. **Calibration**: If required, perform a calibration test by introducing a small amount of liquid to ensure the sensor's responsiveness and accuracy.
6. **Operational Check**: Verify communication by simulating a leak and confirming that alerts are received on the management dashboard.

### LoRaWAN Details

- **Frequency Bands**: Supports EU868, US915, AS923, and other standardized regional frequencies.
- **Data Rate**: Configurable to use adaptive data rate (ADR) for optimized power consumption and network performance.
- **Security**: Utilizes LoRaWANâ€™s AES-128 encryption for secure data transmission.
- **Range**: Capable of transmitting data up to several kilometers in open rural areas or hundreds of meters in dense urban environments.

### Power Consumption

- **Operational Mode**: Consumes approximately 15-25 mW in active use depending on the transmission frequency and interval.
- **Sleep Mode**: Highly efficient with a power draw of less than 1 mW when no leak is detected.
- **Battery Life**: Powered by a lithium-ion battery with an estimated life of up to 5 years, depending on configuration and usage pattern.
- **Energy Efficiency**: Supports solar power options and energy harvesting technologies for extended deployment in remote locations.

### Use Cases

- **Residential Homes**: Monitor for leaks under sinks, within basements, or near appliances to prevent water damage.
- **Commercial Buildings**: Ensure the integrity of plumbing systems in office buildings, shopping centers, and warehouses.
- **Industrial Facilities**: Detect leaks in manufacturing plants, particularly in chemical processing and storage areas.
- **Data Centers**: Protect sensitive electronic equipment from water damage by early detection of cooling system leaks.

### Limitations

- **Environmental Conditions**: Performance may be affected by extreme temperatures or humidity levels beyond specified ranges.
- **Substrate Compatibility**: Sensor effectiveness can vary with different types of surfaces or containment materials where it is installed.
- **Signal Interference**: Metal structures or heavy machinery may impact LoRaWAN signal strength and range.
- **Latency**: While generally low, network congestion or interference can introduce delays in data reporting to the server.

The POLYSENSE Leak Monitoring Sensor offers a robust solution for effective leak detection, combining advanced sensing technology with reliable long-range wireless communication to address the needs of various environments and applications.
