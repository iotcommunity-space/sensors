# Technical Overview of POLYSENSE - Seat Pressure IoT Sensor End Node

## Introduction

The POLYSENSE Seat Pressure IoT Sensor End Node is a sophisticated sensing device designed to detect and analyze pressure on seats or other surfaces. It utilizes advanced IoT technology to transmit data wirelessly over LoRaWAN networks. This makes it an ideal solution for applications in smart buildings, healthcare, transport systems, and more.

## Working Principles

The POLYSENSE device operates via integrated pressure sensors that detect changes in pressure on the surface of the seat. These sensors are designed to have high sensitivity and accuracy, allowing for reliable detection of a range of pressures from subtle movements to heavy loads. The pressure data is processed through an onboard microcontroller which translates pressure readings into digital data.

The collected data is then transmitted wirelessly using LoRaWAN communication technology. LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) enables low-power, long-range wireless communication over licensed-free radio frequencies, ideal for connecting sensors in extensive IoT networks.

## Installation Guide

1. **Location Selection**: Choose a suitable installation site on the seat surface ensuring it is flat and within range of a LoRaWAN gateway. Avoid areas with sharp objects or excessive moisture.

2. **Attachment**: Securely mount the sensor using the adhesive pad or mounting brackets provided. Ensure there is no air gap between the sensor and the contact surface for optimal performance.

3. **Configuration**: Power on the device and use the included configuration software or app to set up initial parameters including device ID, frequency plan, and any specific thresholds for alerts.

4. **Network Connection**: Ensure the device is registered and connected to a LoRaWAN gateway to enable data transmission. Verify signal strength and connectivity.

5. **Testing**: Verify installation by exerting pressure on the installed sensor and checking if the data is correctly sent and received at the application server.

## LoRaWAN Details

- **Frequency Bands**: Supports multiple frequency bands, commonly including EU868, US915, AS923, depending on regional compliance.
- **Data Rates**: Utilizes ADR (Adaptive Data Rate) to optimize data rates and power consumption dynamically.
- **Encryption**: Provides end-to-end encryption ensuring data security with 128-bit AES algorithm.
- **Network Range**: Capable of transmitting data over several kilometers in open areas and several hundred meters in urban settings.

## Power Consumption

The POLYSENSE sensor is designed for low-power operation, supporting extended battery life, crucial for remote IoT installations. Typical power consumption details include:

- **Transmission Mode**: 22.5 mA
- **Idle Mode**: 0.2 mA
- **Battery Life**: Up to 5 years with a standard CR2477 lithium coin cell battery, depending on transmission frequency and data rate settings.

## Use Cases

- **Healthcare**: Monitoring bed occupancy in hospitals to prevent falls and improve patient management.
- **Smart Transportation**: Seat occupancy detection in public transportation for optimizing passenger load and enhancing security measures.
- **Ergonomic Studies**: Analyzing seating patterns and pressure distribution for ergonomic chair designs.
- **Office Spaces**: Integration with smart building systems for efficient workspace utilization.

## Limitations

- **Environmental Constraints**: Not suitable for use in excessively wet or corrosive environments as it may affect sensor performance.
- **Range Limitations**: Performance dependent on the proximity to a LoRaWAN gateway. Dense urban environments may reduce effective range.
- **Pressure Specificity**: Designed primarily for seating applications; may not provide accurate readings on non-seating structures without recalibration.
- **Battery Replacement**: Despite low power consumption, battery life may vary with usage patterns requiring periodic replacement or maintenance.

In summary, the POLYSENSE Seat Pressure IoT Sensor End Node is a robust device offering reliable data transmission and collection for modern IoT applications, while its integration into LoRaWAN networks ensures broad compatibility and ease of use across diverse IoT projects.
