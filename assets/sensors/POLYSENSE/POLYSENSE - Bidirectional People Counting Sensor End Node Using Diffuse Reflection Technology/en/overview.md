### Technical Overview: POLYSENSE Bidirectional People Counting Sensor

#### Introduction
The POLYSENSE Bidirectional People Counting Sensor is an advanced IoT device specifically designed to count people in a predefined area using diffuse reflection technology. It operates as an end node within a LoRaWAN network, transmitting valuable occupancy data to improve space utilization, optimize facility management, and enhance analytics.

#### Working Principles
The core technology of the POLYSENSE sensor is diffuse reflection, which utilizes infrared (IR) light to detect the presence and direction of people passing through a monitored area. When an individual crosses the sensor's path, the emitted IR light reflects off the person back to the sensor. By analyzing the timing and intensity of the reflected signals, the sensor can determine the direction of movement (i.e., entering or exiting). A combination of advanced processing algorithms ensures high accuracy even in variable lighting conditions.

#### Installation Guide
1. **Site Selection**: Choose a location above the area to be monitored, typically over a doorway or passage, ensuring the area is free of obstructions that might interfere with the IR signals.
   
2. **Mounting**: Securely mount the sensor using the provided brackets. The recommended height is between 2-3 meters above ground level to optimize the sensing area and avoid any potential occlusion.

3. **Power Supply**: Connect the sensor to its power source. Make sure to follow the electrical safety guidelines during installation.

4. **Calibration**: Once installed, configure the sensor using the accompanying software tool. Calibration involves setting the sensing area and testing the reflection signal to ensure accuracy.

5. **Network Configuration**: Connect the sensor to the LoRaWAN network by programming the necessary parameters such as DevEUI, AppEUI, and AppKey. Ensure proper network connectivity by conducting a test run to check for data transmission.

#### LoRaWAN Details
- **Frequency Bands**: The sensor supports multiple frequency bands typical for LoRaWAN networks, including EU868, US915, and others as per regional regulations.
- **Data Transmission**: It transmits bidirectional count data in regular intervals or upon threshold-based triggers, depending on the configuration.
- **Security**: Utilizes AES-128 encryption in the network and application layers to secure data transmission.
- **Device Configuration**: Supported through over-the-air activation (OTAA) or activation by personalization (ABP).

#### Power Consumption
- Designed for low power operations to encourage long-term deployment.
- Can be powered by a long-life battery or connected to an external power source.
- Typical battery lifespan extends up to 5 years under normal counting conditions and transmission intervals.

#### Use Cases
- **Office Buildings**: Monitor occupancy levels to manage facility usage effectively and optimize energy consumption.
- **Retail Stores**: Evaluate customer flow to enhance store layout and improve staffing schedules.
- **Event Venues**: Track attendee numbers in real-time for crowd management and safety compliance.
- **Public Infrastructure**: Gather data on the usage of transportation hubs and public spaces to inform development projects.

#### Limitations
- **Environmental Conditions**: Proper operation can be affected by extreme environmental conditions, such as direct sunlight or unusually reflective surfaces.
- **Obstructions**: Objects or installations in the sensorâ€™s line of sight may result in inaccurate people counting.
- **Power Dependency**: Operation depends on sufficient power availability, and the battery life can be shorter under higher frequency data transmissions.

### Conclusion
The POLYSENSE Bidirectional People Counting Sensor offers a robust and versatile solution for applications requiring accurate and reliable people counting capabilities. Its integration within a LoRaWAN framework provides extensive coverage and reliable communication, making it an invaluable tool in smart building and occupancy management scenarios. While it presents some limitations, careful planning and deployment can mitigate most hurdles, ensuring optimal performance.
