## Technical Overview for POLYSENSE - Soil Humidity 33V Sensor

### Introduction
The POLYSENSE Soil Humidity 33V Sensor is an advanced wireless soil moisture sensor designed for precision agriculture, environmental research, and landscaping applications. It leverages LoRaWAN technology for long-range, low-power data transmission, offering robust performance in diverse environmental conditions.

### Working Principles

The POLYSENSE Soil Humidity 33V Sensor operates on capacitive humidity sensing technology. It detects changes in the dielectric constant of the soil, which varies with moisture content. The sensor integrates into a LoRaWAN network to wirelessly transmit data for remote monitoring and analysis. 

- **Capacitive Moisture Sensing**: Utilizes a pair of metal electrodes to form a capacitor whose capacitance changes with soil moisture content.
- **Signal Processing**: The raw signal from the sensor is processed to calculate volumetric water content and transmitted digitally.
- **Temperature Compensation**: Features integrated temperature compensation to reduce measurement errors due to environmental temperature variations.

### Installation Guide

1. **Site Selection**: Choose a representative location for the sensor installation where soil conditions are consistent across the area of interest.
   
2. **Mounting**: Insert the sensor vertically in the soil at the desired depth, ensuring that the entire sensing area is buried. 

3. **Angulation**: Avoid installation at angles that exceed 30 degrees from the vertical to ensure accurate readings.

4. **LoRaWAN Configuration**:
   - **Activate the Device**: Ensure device registration with the intended LoRaWAN network provider.
   - **Network Join**: Power on the sensor and ensure it successfully joins the LoRaWAN network.
   - **Transmitting Settings**: Configure transmission intervals according to application needs (note that more frequent transmissions increase power consumption).

5. **Calibration**: While the sensor is factory-calibrated, in-situ calibration may be necessary for specific soil types to enhance accuracy.

### LoRaWAN Details

- **Frequency Bands**: Supports multiple frequency bands compliant with regional regulations such as EU868, US915, AS923, etc.
- **Data Transmission Rate**: Employs Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) mechanisms to optimize throughput and battery life.
- **Security**: Uses end-to-end encryption for secure data transmission, employing 128-bit AES encryption.

### Power Consumption

- **Sleep Mode**: Averages below 100 Î¼A when idle.
- **Active Mode**: Power consumption ranges from 20 mA to 50 mA during sampling and transmission phases.
- **Battery**: Typically powered by replaceable lithium batteries rated to last several years, depending on transmission frequency and environmental conditions.

### Use Cases

- **Precision Agriculture**: Enables farmers to monitor soil moisture levels, optimize irrigation schedules, and improve crop yields.
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Supports hydrological and climate research by providing essential data on soil water dynamics.
- **Urban Landscaping**: Assists in maintaining optimal soil moisture levels in parks and recreational areas, conserving water resources.

### Limitations

- **Soil Type Dependence**: Accuracy may vary across different soil textures (e.g., sandy vs. clay soils) without proper calibration.
- **High Salinity**: Performance can be affected in saline soils, requiring additional measures or corrective calibrations.
- **Installation Depth**: Performance is contingent on correct installation depth; shallow installations may lead to exposure or inaccurate readings in heavy rainfall.
- **Limited Real-time Feedback**: LoRaWAN, being optimized for low data rates, may not be suitable for applications requiring immediate real-time data.
- **Physical Damage**: Vulnerable to damage from heavy machinery or excavation activities unless properly protected.

### Conclusion

The POLYSENSE Soil Humidity 33V Sensor offers an efficient solution for long-term, low-maintenance soil moisture monitoring across a range of applications. Its integration into LoRaWAN networks ensures extended coverage with minimal power consumption, making it an excellent choice for remote agricultural fields and environmental studies. Understanding and mitigating its limitations will maximize its effectiveness, ensuring reliable and precise measurement outputs.
