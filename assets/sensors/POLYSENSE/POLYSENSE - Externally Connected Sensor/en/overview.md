### Technical Overview: POLYSENSE - Externally Connected Sensor (POLYSENSE)

#### 1. Introduction
The POLYSENSE Externally Connected Sensor is a versatile IoT device designed to interface with external sensors, offering seamless data collection and transmission over LoRaWAN networks. It is particularly suited for applications requiring remote monitoring, such as environmental sensing, infrastructure monitoring, and industrial automation.

#### 2. Working Principles
The POLYSENSE device operates by interfacing with various external sensors via standard input connections. It processes raw sensor data using an integrated microcontroller and transmits it over LoRaWAN networks. The device supports analog, digital, and I2C interfaces, enabling compatibility with a wide array of sensor types.

Key components:
- **Microcontroller**: Processes sensor data and controls communication.
- **LoRaWAN Transceiver**: Manages sending and receiving data via low-power, long-range radio communication.
- **Power Management Unit (PMU)**: Optimizes battery usage and manages power states.

#### 3. Installation Guide
1. **Unboxing and Inspection**:
   - Verify all contents according to the packing list.
   - Inspect for any physical damage.

2. **Mounting**:
   - Select a location suitable for the specific sensor to be used.
   - Use appropriate mounting hardware to securely attach the POLYSENSE device in a stable position.

3. **Sensor Connection**:
   - Connect external sensors to the POLYSENSE using the appropriate port (analog, digital, or I2C).
   - Ensure that connections are secure and weatherproofed if deployed outdoors.

4. **Power Setup**:
   - Install batteries or connect to an external power source according to the power requirements listed in the technical specifications.

5. **Configuration**:
   - Configure device settings using the manufacturer-provided application or through a direct communication interface.
   - Set transmission intervals, threshold alarms, and LoRaWAN connectivity parameters such as the device EUI, App EUI, and App Key.

6. **Testing and Calibration**:
   - Power on the device and perform initial testing to ensure proper data communication and functionality.
   - Calibrate connected sensors according to specific application needs.

#### 4. LoRaWAN Details
- **Frequency Bands**: Supports multiple regional ISM frequency bands, including EU868, US915, AS923, etc.
- **Data Rate**: LoRaWAN data rates range from DR0 to DR5 (or higher, depending on regional regulations).
- **Network Integration**: Compatible with standard LoRaWAN Network Servers, facilitating integration into existing IoT ecosystems.
- **Security**: Utilizes AES-128 encryption for secure data transmission.

#### 5. Power Consumption
- **Idle Mode**: <0.1 mW
- **Active Mode**: 50 mW to 150 mW (depending on sensor activity and communication intervals)
- **Battery Life**: Up to 5 years with average usage settings and periodic transmission (assuming a high-capacity lithium battery).

#### 6. Use Cases
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Deploy with temperature, humidity, and barometric sensors to collect climate data in agriculture or forestry.
- **Infrastructure Monitoring**: Use with structural health sensors to detect changes in bridges, buildings, or dams.
- **Industrial Automation**: Integrate with pressure, flow, or level sensors to enhance process controls in manufacturing or water management systems.

#### 7. Limitations
- **Range Limitations**: Effective communication range is subject to geographical and architectural interference. Ideal conditions yield up to 15 km in rural and 2-5 km in urban settings.
- **Data Throughput Constraints**: Limited by LoRaWAN bandwidth; not suitable for high-frequency or large-volume data requirements.
- **Temperature and Weather Resistance**: While designed for wide temperature ranges, extreme conditions may require additional protective housing.
