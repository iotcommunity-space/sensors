# Technical Overview: POLYSENSE - Soil Humidity Sensor 33V (POLYSENSE)

## Introduction
POLYSENSE Soil Humidity Sensor 33V is designed to accurately measure and monitor soil moisture levels. Utilizing advanced LoRaWAN technology, this sensor is ideal for agricultural applications, landscaping, and environmental studies, contributing to efficient water resource management and enhanced crop yield.

## Working Principles
The POLYSENSE Soil Humidity Sensor operates on the principle of capacitive measurement, which assesses soil moisture by evaluating changes in capacitance. As soil moisture content varies, it affects the dielectric constant of the soil material, which in turn alters the capacitance. The sensor translates these changes into soil humidity readings that can be transmitted via LoRaWAN.

## Installation Guide
1. **Site Selection**:
   - Choose a representative location that reflects the average conditions of the land area being monitored.
   - Ensure the site is free from large rocks and deep-rooted vegetation which can affect readings.

2. **Installation Steps**:
   - Dig a small hole to the desired depth, ensuring minimal disturbance to soil structure.
   - Insert the sensor probe vertically, ensuring full contact with the soil. The entire probe length should be buried for consistent readings.
   - Backfill the hole and gently compact the soil to ensure proper contact.
   - Mount the sensorâ€™s data transmission unit above ground, securing it to a stable structure to protect from environmental elements.

3. **Connection**:
   - Connect the sensor probe to the data transmission unit using the provided cable.
   - Ensure all electrical connections are secure and protected from moisture ingress.

## LoRaWAN Details
- **Frequency Bands**: Supports EU868, US915, AS923, and other regional LoRaWAN bands.
- **Communication Range**: Up to 15 kilometers in rural open areas, with reduced range in urban settings due to obstructions.
- **Data Transmission Intervals**: Configurable intervals ranging from minutes to hours.
- **OTAA and ABP Support**: Offers both Over-The-Air Activation and Activation by Personalization for flexible network deployment.

## Power Consumption
- **Power Supply**: Operates on a 3.3V power supply.
- **Battery Life**: Utilizes a high-capacity lithium-ion battery, with a life expectancy of up to 10 years depending on transmission frequency and environmental conditions.
- **Low Power Mode**: The sensor incorporates a low power mode to conserve energy between data transmissions, optimizing battery life significantly.

## Use Cases
- **Agricultural Monitoring**: Enhances precision agriculture by delivering real-time soil moisture data, aiding irrigation scheduling, and reducing water waste.
- **Landscaping**: Ensures optimal soil conditions for plant health in gardens and parks, preventing overwatering or drought stress.
- **Environmental Research**: Useful in scientific studies focusing on soil-water relationships, climate change impact on soil moisture, and hydrological modeling.

## Limitations
- **Soil Type Sensitivity**: Performance may vary with different soil textures and compositions. Calibration is recommended for non-standard or extreme soil conditions.
- **Temperature Limitations**: While designed for outdoor use, the sensor has operational temperature limits; extreme heat or freezing conditions might affect accuracy and lifespan.
- **Signal Obstruction**: In densely built-up areas or terrains with significant geographic obstructions, LoRaWAN signal range might be considerably reduced.
- **Maintenance**: Over time, the probe may require cleaning to prevent soil build-up and ensure precision.

The POLYSENSE Soil Humidity Sensor 33V is a robust, reliable solution for continuous soil moisture monitoring, providing valuable data to optimize water resource management and support sustainable agricultural practices. Proper installation and maintenance are critical for maximizing its accuracy and lifespan.
