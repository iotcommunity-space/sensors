# Technical Overview
## KINEIS Custom Kineis (KINEIS)

### Working Principles

KINEIS Custom Kineis (KINEIS), is a powerful device that operates based on Low Power Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) protocol. It is part of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology, designed to harvest and transmit vast amounts of data collected from diverse fields to create effective solutions for different applications. By making use of LoRaWAN connectivity, high-frequency signal transmission, and advanced server technology, KINEIS allows for seamless and robust data communication over long distances.

### Installation Guide

Installing KINEIS is a relatively intuitive process:

1. **Locating the Device**: Position the device in an area with a direct line-of-sight to the sky for better satellite communication.
2. **Set Device Settings**: Configure the device settings such as payload size, frequency and duty cycle.
3. **Connect to Network Server**: Pair the device with the LoRaWAN network server by entering the device's EUI and the application key.

It's important to follow manufacturer's guidelines while installing KINEIS to avoid improper installation and maximize the device's performance.

### LoRaWAN Details

KINEIS takes advantage of the secure, power-efficient, and long-range capabilities of the LoRaWAN protocol. It utilizes Adaptive Data Rate (ADR), which varies the data rate and RF output for each device based on its proximity to the nearest gateway and its current channel conditions. This results in the optimal balance of range, battery life, and data transfer speeds for each sensor.

### Power Consumption

As IoT devices, KINEIS's main selling point is its low power consumption. It operates at an ultra-low power level by spending the majority of its time in sleep mode, only waking up to relay data at set intervals, or when triggered by a sensor reading. This, coupled with the efficient LoRaWAN protocol, allows KINEIS devices to operate on the same battery for several years, depending on the usage and environment.

### Use Cases

Graduates of fields from agriculture to fleet tracking and asset management, KINEIS allows businesses to create secure, scalable, and power-efficient IoT solutions. Due to the long-range capabilities of KINEIS devices, they are particularly useful in locations where traditional mobile networks are unreliable, such as rural and remote areas. 

### Limitations

Despite its versatile applications, KINEIS devices have some limitations. The maximum data rate is limited by the LoRaWAN protocol to approximately 250 kbps, which may not support high-bandwidth applications like streaming video. Furthermore, the devices must have an unobstructed line-of-sight to the sky for reliable connections, making it less effective in certain environments such as dense urban areas. The actual range of the device may also vary based on deployment and environmental factors. Also, encryption energy assumes an extra overhead in power consumption as compared to unencrypted communications.
