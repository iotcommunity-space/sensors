### TTN Smart Sensor (Cital) Technical Documentation

## Overview:

The TTN Smart Sensor (Cital) is a highly functional, compact and low power sensor, which operates based on the Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) technology. The sensor provides real-time data, a feature that enhances efficiency in several fields (farming, industrial processes etc.), and facilitates remote data acquisition.

## Working Principle:

The TTN Smart Sensor works on the basis of LoRaWAN protocol. This technology allows for long-range communication with minimized power consumption. Communication occurs between the sensor and LoRaWAN gateway, from where data is pushed to the Cloud. The process involves converting input signals into sought data using a micro processor embedded in the sensor. Collected data is transmitted to gateways through LoRaWAN technology.

## Installation Guide:

1. Physically install the sensor at the desired position.
2. Using LoRaWAN technology, connect the sensor to a local LoRa network.
3. Configure the TTN Smart Sensor by connecting it to your local server. The server's IP address and port number need to be provided.
4. On a successful connection, the TTN Smart Sensor starts to send acquisition data to the application server.

## LoRaWAN Details:

The LoRaWAN protocol used by TTN Smart Sensor allows for a broad coverage of up to several kilometers. It operates on the 868MHz frequency band for Europe and 915MHz for North America, but this can be configured according to regional standards.

## Power Consumption:

The TTN Smart Sensor is designed to be energy-efficient. Its low-power consumption is a result of the LoRaWAN protocol that enables the sensor to stay in sleep mode when data is not being transmitted, thus saving battery life. However, exact power consumption may vary according to configuration, transmission cycle, and payload size.

## Use Cases:

1. Agriculture: Measures soil moisture and temperature in vineyards, farms, etc.
2. Asset Tracking: Tracks location and condition of assets in warehouses or during transport.
3. Environment monitoring: Monitors air quality, temperature, humidity and water quality in urban or inaccessible areas.
4. Infrastructure: Monitors the structural health of buildings, bridges, and tunnels.

## Limitations:

1. LoRaWAN dependent: The sensor's functionality is based on the coverage of LoRaWAN. In regions with poor LoRa coverage, the sensor might show limited functionality.
2. Latency: Due to its low power consumption approach, sensors may experience latency issues when transmitting real-time data.
3. Limited Payload: LoRaWAN supports limited payload size, hence data transmission is limited to few bytes only. So, it's not feasible for applications requiring high data rate.
