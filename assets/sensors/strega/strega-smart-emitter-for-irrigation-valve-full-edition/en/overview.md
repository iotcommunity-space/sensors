### Technical Overview of STREGA - Smart Emitter For Irrigation Valve Full Edition

#### Introduction
The STREGA Smart Emitter is a cutting-edge IoT solution designed to automate and optimize irrigation systems. It integrates seamlessly into existing infrastructure, leveraging LoRaWAN technology for efficient water management across vast agricultural fields, urban landscapes, and complex horticultural environments.

#### Working Principles
The STREGA Smart Emitter is engineered to control irrigation valves wirelessly, utilizing LoRaWAN for long-range communication. The device operates by receiving commands over the LoRaWAN network, which trigger the opening or closing of the connected valve. It integrates sensors that can monitor environmental conditions such as soil moisture and weather changes, thereby optimizing irrigation schedules based on real-time data.

Key components include:
- **Microcontroller**: Manages communication and control functions.
- **LoRa Module**: Ensures secure long-range transmission of data to and from the emitter.
- **Actuator Interface**: Directly controls the valve actuation mechanism.
- **Sensor Inputs**: Accommodates third-party sensors for comprehensive environmental monitoring.

#### Installation Guide
1. **Site Assessment**: Determine valve locations and ensure there is adequate LoRaWAN network coverage.
2. **Mounting**: Attach the STREGA Smart Emitter to the valve assembly securely, ensuring all connections are watertight to prevent exposure to adverse environmental conditions.
3. **Power Supply**: Connect the device to its power supply, choosing between battery options or an external power source if available.
4. **Network Configuration**: Integrate the device into the existing LoRaWAN network by registering it on the network server with its unique device identifiers.
5. **Calibration**: If applicable, calibrate sensors by following manufacturer guidelines to achieve accurate readings.
6. **Testing**: Conduct a series of test operations to ensure the valve responds correctly to remote commands.

#### LoRaWAN Details
- **Frequency Bands**: Compatible with regional LoRaWAN frequency plans, including EU868, US915, and others.
- **Data Transmission**: Supports Class A and Class C operations, providing flexibility in communication intervals based on application requirements.
- **Security**: Utilizes AES-128 encryption for secure transport of data across the network.
- **Network Integration**: Compatible with major LoRaWAN network servers, facilitating seamless integration into diverse network ecosystems.

#### Power Consumption
- **Mode of Operation**: The device operates in low-power mode when idle, consuming minimal energy to extend battery life.
- **Battery Efficiency**: Optimized to function on low-voltage power sources, typically providing a battery life of up to 10 years depending on usage patterns and environmental conditions.
