**Technical Overview of STREGA - Smart Valve Lite Edition (STREGA)**

**I. Working Principles**

The Smart Valve Lite Edition by STREGA operates on the principle of actuator-based valve control designed for remote operations, compatible with different types of valves like solenoid, ball, butterfly, or globe valves. It uses electromagnetic and electromechanical actuators to precisely control the valve's open-close operations, thus allowing the control application to respond in real-time.

The entire operation is coordinated over a secure and energy-efficient LoRaWAN wireless network which not only facilitates valve operations but also collects key metrics and status updates from the valve for process optimization and preventative maintenance.

The Smart Valve integrates an innovative built-in valve state detection feature, providing accurate sensing of the valve position (open/close). 

**II. Installation Guide**

1. The device can be installed directly onto different types of valves with standard mounting brackets (conforms to ISO 5211) provided with the unit. 

2. It should be connected to the LoRaWAN network, following the standard pairing procedure. This involves setting the correct frequency and data rate for communication while accounting for regional regulations.

3. Once connected, it can be configured via a Web-based management interface, allowing you to set schedules, turn the valve on or off manually, and adjust other settings.

**III. LoRaWAN Details**

STREGA Smart-Valve employs LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) for communication due to its long-range, low-power, and secure data transmission properties. Depending on the region and terrain, it can communicate over distances up to 15-20 km without much power, making it ideal for IoT applications in remote or difficult-to-reach locations.

LoRaWAN also provides advanced security features, including unique network, application and device keys, and end-to-end encryption, ensuring that the data transmitted between the valve and the control application remains confidential and tamper-proof.

**IV. Power Consumption**

STREGA's Smart Valve is designed for minimal power consumption. The device is powered by a long-life replaceable battery, which can last up to 10 years depending on the frequency of valve operation. The device also supports solar panels for autonomous operation, making it ideal for remote locations.

**V. Use Cases**

STREGA's Smart Valve is versatile and can be used in a wide variety of applications such as:
1. Water Management Systems: For controlling the supply of water and managing irrigation in real-time.
2. Industrial Automation: For managing fluid flow in industrial processes.
3. Leakage Management: To prevent water wastage and property damage by automatically shutting off the valve.
4. Industrial Safety: For emergency shutdowns when hazardous conditions are detected.

**VI. Limitation**

While STREGA's Smart Valve has many merits, some limitations include:
1. It requires a LoRaWAN gateway within its range to function properly. 
2. Its operation is limited by the life of its battery, although it is designed to be energy efficient.
3. Its performance may also be affected by extreme environmental conditions.
4. Its communication range may decrease in areas with significant physical obstructions.

Overall, the STREGA valve is a robust, energy-efficient, and versatile IoT device that leverages LoRaWAN technology to deliver reliable, remote valve operation in a range of environments and applications.
