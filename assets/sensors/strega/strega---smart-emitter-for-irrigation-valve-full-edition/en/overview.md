### Technical Overview for STREGA - Smart Emitter for Irrigation Valve Full Edition (STREGA)

#### Working Principles
STREGA Smart Emitter for Irrigation Valve operates using wireless LoRa technology to control remote irrigation systems. The emitter is designed to use minimal power and communicate with a centralized control system over long ranges to enable the opening or closing of valve mechanisms. It receives scheduled instruction messages sent over a low-frequency, low-power data network, and uses these to adjust and regulate the flow of irrigation systems, all in real-time.

#### Installation Guide
Installing the STREGA Smart Emitter involves securing the unit physically onto the existing valve system in an irrigation setup. This process usually involves attaching the device via mounting brackets. Once secure, the emitter is then paired with the central control system. This pairing is achieved using an installation wizard that will guide you through the pairing process on either the device’s interface, a smartphone app, or through a connected PC. 

#### LoRaWAN Details
STREGA Smart Emitter uses LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) technology to communicate with other connected devices. LoRaWAN is a medium access control (MAC) protocol for wide area networks designed to support massive networks of low-power devices such as IoT devices. Operating in the sub-gigahertz frequency band, LoRa devices have a much farther reach compared to other wireless technologies, allowing for a single base station to provide coverage across a large area.

#### Power Consumption
STREGA Smart Emitter has been designed with low power consumption at the forefront of its construction. The device uses approximately 1.5µA in sleep mode and around 25mA in transmit mode. The total power consumed by the device will mainly depend on the operational conditions and transmission frequency. It is driven by a 3.6V AA lithium battery which provides a long-lasting power source for the device.

#### Use Cases
This technology has a wide range of applications but is mainly used for agricultural automation, where it can significantly reduce invested time and manpower for irrigation processes. STREGA can be used in public parks, golf courses, private gardens, or large scale crop fields where the remote activation of water valves is necessary. It can also be deployed in harsh or remote environments where traditional control systems may not be feasible or efficient.

#### Limitations
The most significant limiting factor for STREGA Smart Emitter is the LoRaWAN network coverage. While this technology is impressive in its range, it is still subject to possible interference or loss of communication in particularly remote or densely constructed areas. Moreover, as the device is dependent on the battery, the estimated life can vary based on signal strength, message frequency, and environmental conditions. Lastly, while the device is robust, it might not withstand extreme physical and climatic conditions.
