Title: ADENUIS - Analog and Power (ADENUIS) Technical Overview 

1. Overview: 
ADENUIS Analog and Power (ADENUIS) is an innovative Internet of Things (IoT) sensor module that facilitates detection, measurement, and conversion of analog signals into digital data for remote monitoring and control. It utilizes low-power wide-area network protocol known as LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) to deliver effective two-way communication in urban or geographically isolated settings.

2. Working Principles: 
ADENUIS operates by capturing input from the physical environment via analog signals, processing these via a set of power sub-systems, and converting them into digital data. This data is then transmitted over a LoRaWAN to an IoT gateway, visible on the user's end for monitoring, analysis or triggering automatic responses.

3. Installation Guide: 
To install ADENUIS, first identify an optimal location that is protected from environmental extremes. Attach the sensor securely and connect to the power supply (either battery or solar, depending on use-case). Connect the device to your LoRaWAN network by following the network provider's procedure for adding a new device. Ensure the device is properly configured to communicate with your gateway.

4. LoRaWAN details: 
ADENUIS leverages the low-power consumption and widespread range capabilities of LoRaWAN for remote communication. It can operate in different LoRaWAN classes (A, B, C) and within the LoRaWAN frequency band specified by your region.

5. Power Consumption: 
ADENUIS is designed for low power consumption, enhancing its attractiveness for deployment in isolated locations or where power sources are limited. It can operate effectively under variable power conditions and with power consumption as low as 10uA in sleep mode. This makes it ultra-energy efficient and suitable for long-term operations.

6. Use Cases: 
The versatility of ADENUIS enables its deployment across a wide variety of sectors. Examples of use-cases include monitoring in agricultural, industrial, and environmental contexts. Additionally, power utility companies can utilize this technology for monitoring power lines, transformers and other critical infrastructure for real-time energy utilization and disrupt detection.

7. Limitations: 
Despite its innovative features, ADENUIS has some limitations. Its operation depends heavily on analog signals and it may struggle in environments with high levels of electromagnetic interference. The long-range communication of LoRaWAN is also contingent on line-of-sight without obstructive structures or terrains and thus, may suffer in densely constructed environments. Additionally, despite being energy efficient, the device will require a power source replacement or recharge after drainage, which might be challenging in remote installations.
