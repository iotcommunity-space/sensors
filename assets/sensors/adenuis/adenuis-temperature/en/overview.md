# ADENUIS - Temperature Sensor Technical Overview

## Introduction

The ADENUIS Temperature sensor is a highly efficient IoT device designed for remote temperature monitoring applications. It leverages LoRaWAN technology for reliable and extended-range data transmission, making it ideal for use in diverse environments where wired connectivity is challenging or impractical.

## Working Principles

The ADENUIS temperature sensor operates based on a thermistor or resistance temperature detector (RTD), which changes resistance in response to temperature variations. This sensor translates the resistance changes into temperature readings. The data is digitized and sent over LoRaWAN networks, allowing for secure and efficient communication over long distances.

The sensor is typically a passive device powered by an internal battery, ensuring a long operational life with minimal maintenance. The data readings can be configured for specific intervals and thresholds, enabling tailored monitoring solutions.

## Installation Guide

### Required Tools and Equipment

- ADENUIS Temperature Sensor
- Mounting hardware (if applicable)
- Smartphone or computer with LoRaWAN configuration capabilities
- Screwdriver and screws for mounting

### Installation Steps

1. **Placement**: 
   - Choose an appropriate location that represents the area you wish to monitor. Ensure it is within the range of a LoRaWAN gateway.
   
2. **Mounting**:
   - Use the provided mounting hardware to secure the sensor. It should be positioned where it is not exposed to direct sunlight or extreme environmental conditions.
   
3. **Configuration**:
   - Use a smartphone or computer to connect to the sensor through available configuration tools.
   - Input the necessary LoRaWAN parameters: Device EUI, Application EUI, and Application Key.

4. **Testing**:
   - Conduct a connectivity and data transmission test to confirm successful interaction with the LoRaWAN network.
   - Adjust settings if necessary for optimal performance.

## LoRaWAN Details

- **Frequency Band:** Depends on regional regulations (e.g., EU868, US915).
- **Data Rate:** Utilizes adaptive data rate (ADR) feature for optimal performance.
- **Security Features:** End-to-end encryption using AES128 ensures data integrity and confidentiality.
- **Network Compatibility:** Compatible with standard LoRaWAN networks and can be easily integrated into existing LoRaWAN infrastructure.

## Power Consumption

The ADENUIS sensor is equipped with a high-capacity lithium battery designed to provide extended operation:

- **Battery Life**: Typically 5-10 years, depending on transmission frequency and environmental conditions.
- **Power-Saving Modes**: The sensor utilizes sleep mode to conserve power when not actively transmitting data.
  
## Use Cases

- **Smart Agriculture**: Monitor soil temperatures to optimize crop yields and manage farming practices.
- **Cold Chain Monitoring**: Ensure the integrity of temperature-sensitive goods during transport and storage.
- **HVAC Systems**: Enhance building climate control by providing real-time data to optimize energy consumption.
- **Industrial Environments**: Maintain equipment within specified temperature ranges to prevent overheating and damage.

## Limitations

- **Environmental Constraints**: The sensor may not perform optimally in environments with extreme temperatures or humidity beyond its operational range.
- **Network Dependency**: Effective data transmission relies on coverage by a LoRaWAN gateway, potentially limiting usability in remote areas lacking network infrastructure.
- **Update Frequency**: Limited to specific interval settings which may not satisfy applications requiring real-time, high-frequency data.
  
In summary, the ADENUIS Temperature sensor is a robust solution for many temperature monitoring applications, offering easy installation, low power consumption, and reliable long-range communication through LoRaWAN. However, understanding its limitations is essential to ensure it meets the specific needs of your application.
