## Technical Overview of ADENUIS - Dry Contacts (ADENUIS)

### Working Principles
The ADENUIS - Dry Contacts sensor is a low-power wireless sensor designed to detect the presence or absence of an electrical connection. It works based on the "dry contact concept," whereby a relay or switch is said to offer a dry contact output if it can provide an open or closed contact without any voltage applied.

If the status of the output (open or closed) changes, the dry contact sensor detects and records such changes. This approach allows the ADENUIS – Dry Contacts to monitor a variety of devices or states, ranging from door openings to system failures.

### Installation Guide
Installing the ADENUIS – Dry Contacts involves connecting it to the equipment whose states need to be monitored. The sensor comes equipped with two wires extending from the unit; these should be connected to the device in question. 

1. Connect these wires to the device's relay or switch.
2. Install the ADENUIS – Dry Contacts in an optional protective casing for improved durability or if operating in a harsh environment.
3. It's recommended to carry out a test run to confirm that the sensor detects and tracks any change in state accurately.

### LoRaWAN Details
ADENUIS – Dry Contacts sensor uses LoRaWAN connectivity for transmission of its data. LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) provides a long range, low power wireless platform enabling efficient data transmission over large geographical areas. 

The sensor sends its data to a central system via a nearby LoRaWAN gateway. Each transmission is encrypted to ensure data security, and the range of transmission depends on the specific LoRaWAN band used, which varies based on regional regulations. The sensor complies with the LoRaWAN 1.0.2 specification, enabling seamless integration with any LoRaWAN compliant network.

### Power Consumption
Being a low-power sensor, the ADENUIS – Dry Contacts boasts low energy consumption, designed to consume as little power as possible to prolong its battery life. It operates using a supplied 3.6V Lithium battery, ensuring years of maintenance-free operation under normal usage conditions. The actual battery life depends on the transmission rate and environmental conditions.

### Use Cases
1. **Door Monitoring:** The ADENUIS – Dry Contacts can easily be connected to a door switch to monitor and track door opening and closing events.
2. **Alarm Systems:** The sensor can monitor alarm system states, detect system failures, and track the activation/deactivation sequences for security purposes.
3. **Equipment State Monitoring:** The sensor can track specific operations of industrial equipment, monitoring whether they are in operation or idle.

### Limitations
Despite being able to operate in a wide range of scenarios, there are a couple of limitations with the ADENUIS – Dry Contacts sensor:

1. **Limited Scope:** The sensor can only detect on/off output or open/closed states. Analogue inputs or variable states cannot be tracked using these sensors.
2. **Dependency on External Devices:** The ADENUIS – Dry Contacts sensor does not generate signals by itself. It is dependent on the change of state on the connected device or switch.
3. **Operating Environment:** While the sensor is designed to function in a wide range of environmental conditions, extremely harsh or unstable environments might affect performance and battery life.

In conclusion, the ADENUIS – Dry Contacts sensor offers a reliable and effective sensor solution for monitoring basic state changes with the advantage of long-range LoRaWAN connectivity and low power consumption.
