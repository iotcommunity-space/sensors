## Technical Overview of ADENUIS - Analog And Power (ADENUIS)

### 1. Introduction
ADENUIS is a cutting-edge IoT sensor designed to facilitate seamless integration of analog and power monitoring capabilities within your IoT infrastructure. Leveraging LoRaWAN technology, ADENUIS offers extended range communication, making it a vital component for remote monitoring applications. It is ideal for industries requiring constant supervision of analog signals and power metrics.

### 2. Working Principles

#### 2.1. Analog Monitoring
ADENUIS is equipped with high-precision analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) that measure voltage, current, temperature, and other analog signals. This data is digitized for processing and transmission. The sensor uses differential input technique to minimize noise interference, ensuring accurate readings.

#### 2.2. Power Monitoring
The device integrates power monitoring capabilities that allow users to track real-time power consumption and energy metrics such as voltage, current, power factor, and total energy usage. This is achieved through onboard shunts and current transformers which sense electrical parameters directly from the connected lines.

#### 2.3. Communication
ADENUIS utilizes LoRaWAN technology to transmit data over long distances with low power consumption. The built-in LoRa transceiver operates in the unlicensed ISM bands, which provides robust, secure, and scalable communication.

### 3. Installation Guide

#### 3.1. Site Preparation
- Ensure a clear path for LoRaWAN signal propagation.
- Verify that the environment is conducive to sensor operations (temperature, humidity, etc.).

#### 3.2. Hardware Setup

1. **Mounting the Device**: Use the provided brackets or adhesives to securely mount the ADENUIS sensor in a strategic location.
2. **Wiring**: Connect the analog and power lines to the appropriate terminal blocks. Ensure tight connections to avoid data inaccuracies.
3. **Power Supply**: ADENUIS can be powered via an external 12V DC supply. For further reliability, ensure that the power supply is stable and protected against surges.

#### 3.3. Configuring the Sensor

1. **Activate the Device**: Power on the device by connecting it to the power source.
2. **Connect to LoRaWAN Network**:
   - Access the sensor’s configuration tool via Bluetooth or USB.
   - Enter the necessary network credentials (AppEUI, DevEUI, AppKey).
3. **Testing**: Perform initial testing by cross-referencing sensor readings with another validated source.

### 4. LoRaWAN Details

#### 4.1. Frequency Band
