Technical Overview: ADENUIS - Pulse (ADENUIS)

Working Principles:

ADENUIS – Pulse is an advanced sensor designed to measure and monitor pulse signals in IoT applications. The working principle of this sensor involves the use of electronic interfacing to detect changes in the pulses. The device converts these pulses into readable data which it transfers via the LoRaWAN network. The data can then be accessed and analyzed on the designated platform.

Installation Guide:

The installation of ADENUIS – Pulse requires technical expertise. The process includes the following steps:

1. Configure the device settings based on your network and application requirements using the provided software.
2. Mount the sensor at the desired location, ensuring it's in the range of your LoRaWAN gateway.
3. Connect the sensor to the device whose pulses you want to measure. Ensure the device and the sensor are properly connected.
4. Test the sensor to confirm data is being sent and received correctly through the network.

LoRaWAN Details:

ADENUIS – Pulse utilizes LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) for communication. It operates on class A or C with configurable data rate ranging between 0 and 5. The device supports up to 8 multiple channels and complies with LoRaWAN 1.0.2 specifications.

Power Consumption:

Designed with energy-efficiency in mind, ADENUIS – Pulse requires very minimal power for operation. Equipped with an improved power management system, it uses only a fraction of the power utilized by similar devices in the market when in idle or active state. However, actual power consumption largely depends on frequency of data transmission and configuration settings.

Use Cases:

ADENUIS – Pulse can be utilized in a wide range of applications including:

1. Energy Management: The sensor can be used to monitor energy consumption in buildings to optimize usage and reduce energy costs.
2. Water Management: In the water industry, it can monitor pulse outputs of water meters for efficient usage and leak detection.
3. Industrial Automation: In industries, the device can be applied to keep track of production lines, monitor equipment performance, and detect abnormal behaviours.

Limitations:

While ADENUIS – Pulse is a versatile device, it has some limitations. 

1. Range: The range of the sensor may be limited by physical barriers and environmental conditions affecting the LoRaWAN connectivity.
2. Interference: The device may experience interference with other electronic devices, impacting its performance.
3. Dependency on LoRaWAN: Since it's dependent on LoRaWAN for data transmission, network downtime or issues with the gateway could affect data relay.
4. Installation: It requires technical knowledge to install and configure making it challenging for individuals without technical background.
