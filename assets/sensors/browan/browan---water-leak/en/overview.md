Title: Technical Overview: BROWAN - Water Leak (BROWAN) Sensor 

**Working Principles**

BROWAN Water Leak Sensor operates on the principle of electrical conductivity of water. It employs two exposed metal electrodes positioned close together. The device remains dormant until water connects these two electrodes, forming an electrical conductive path. A signal is then generated and transmitted wirelessly to a pre-configured network for an immediate alert.

**Installation Guide**

Installing the BROWAN Water Leak Sensor is a fairly straightforward process. 

1. Identify the area prone to water leaks ie. basements, kitchens, restrooms, or appliances like washing machines.

2. Place the sensor on the desired spot making sure the two metal electrodes are in contact with the surface.

3. Set up connectivity. Connect the device to the internet, then pair it with your wireless router, and finally, connect it with your mobile device.

4. Configure notifications. Settings can differ based on your specific requirements.

**LoRaWAN Details**

BROWAN Water Leak Sensor utilizes LoRaWAN (Low Power, Long Range, and Wide Area Network) technology. LoRaWAN is a media access control (MAC) protocol designed for large-scale public networks with a single operator. This technology provides seamless interoperability among smart things without the need for complex local installation – giving freedom back to the user, developer and businesses, enabling the rollout of internet of things.

**Power Consumption**

BROWAN Water Leak Sensor operates on battery power, ensuring ultra-low power consumption. It uses the available power optimally, reacting only when a leak is detected and allowing the device to have an extended life span. 

**Use Cases**

BROWAN Water Leak Sensor is designed to mitigate the impacts of water leakage and resultant damages in various environments:

1. Residential: Prevent damages from water leaks in homes, apartments, and dormitory buildings.
2. Commercial: Protect valuable documents, expensive equipment, and technology in offices from water damage.
3. Industrial: Identify mechanical failures in time in factories and warehouses.

**Limitations**

While the BROWAN Water Leak Sensor is certainly a revolution in IoT, it does have few limitations:

1. Deployment Difficulty: While the sensor itself is easy to install, configuring it with various systems can sometimes be a challenging task.
2. Coverage: The coverage of the sensor could be limited by the LoRaWAN range in the area.
3. Single Point of Failure: The sensor’s dependency on the battery means it fails to operate when the battery is drained.
4. False Alarms: Since it works on conductivity, the sensor may fail to distinguish between the tap water and hazardous liquid leaks.
