**Technical Overview: BROWAN - Temperature Humidity Sensor**

**Working Principles:**
The BROWAN Temperature Humidity Sensor is an Internet of Things (IoT) device that uses electronic sensing elements to monitor the temperature and humidity levels within a certain environment. Once the sensor captures the data, it transmits the information to the user or the mainframe system for analysis through the LoRaWAN network. The sensor uses a digital output type and provides measurement ranges of -40 to 80 degrees Celsius for temperature and 0 to 100 % RH for humidity.

**Installation Guide:**
1. Attach the accompanying bracket to the wall or preferred surface using screws.
2. Insert the sensor device into the bracket ensuring fitting.
3. Open the system software on your computer or smart device and set up your account.
4. Follow the directions to pair the device to your account using the appropriate identification numbers found on the sensor device.
5. Check the connection by reviewing the data coming into your software to ensure the sensor is connected and transmitting data correctly.

**LoRaWAN Details:**
The BROWAN sensor operates within the Long Range WAN (LoRaWAN) framework, a protocol designed for wireless battery-operated 'things' that targets key requirements of IoT such as secure bi-directional communication, mobility and localization services. Its architecture supports long network range up to 15 kilometers in suburban areas while minimizing power consumption.

**Power Consumption:**
This sensor has a low power consumption profile, making it suitable for long-term use in varying environments. It uses two AA batteries, offering 5-10 years of battery life depending on the frequency of data transmission and environmental factors.

**Use Cases:**
1. Smart Building: The BROWAN sensor can be used in both residential and commercial buildings to maintain optimal temperature and humidity levels, contributing to energy efficiency and comfort.
2. Agriculture: It can provide real-time temperature and humidity data to farmers, helping in the creation of optimized conditions for crop growth.
3. Cold Chain Monitoring: Ensure safe storage and transportation of time and temperature-sensitive products such as food and pharmaceuticals by monitoring temperature and humidity changes in storage units and transportation vehicles.

**Limitations:**
While this sensor provides many benefits, it does have some limitations. Its effectiveness can be hindered by physical obstacles and intense weather conditions interrupting signal transmission. The LoRaWAN reception and transmission can be affected by the density of the network, with a higher density of devices leading to a slower transmission rate. Lastly, while power consumption is generally low, extremely cold temperatures can result in shorter battery life.

The BROWAN Temperature Humidity Sensor, considering its broad measurement range, long battery life, versatility, and ease of use, offers a powerful tool for diverse applications across various industries despite the mentioned limitations.
