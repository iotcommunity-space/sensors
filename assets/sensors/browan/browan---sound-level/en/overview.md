Title: Technical Documentation of BROWAN - Sound Level

1. Overview:
BROWAN Sound Level (BROWAN) is a high-precision IoT sensor that measures the noise level in a specific environment. It leverages the micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) microphone technology and sound pressure levels (SPL) measurement to provide an accurate sound level status and detect any changes in ambient noise.

2. Working Principles:
The BROWAN sensor operates by capturing sound signals with the MEMS microphone that translates these sound waves into electrical signals. The integrated SPL measurement calculates the level of sound pressure in decibels (dB) from these electrical signals. These data are then transmitted via LoRaWAN technology.

3. Installation Guide:
To install the BROWAN sound level sensor, specific steps should be followed:
  i. Choose a location where you want to monitor sound levels for ideal placement.
  ii. Fix the sensor on a wall or ceiling using mounting brackets, ensure its microphone is unobstructed.
iii. Connect it to your LoRaWAN network following the manufacturer's instructions, typically involving pairing through scanning a QR code or inputting specific sensor information.

4. LoRaWAN Details:
BROWAN utilizes LoRaWAN technology, a long-range, low-power wireless platform that is an ideal solution for IoT networks worldwide. This technology allows for long-range communication of data (up to 15 km in rural areas), with minimized power consumption, strengthening the system's efficiency. The sensor supports LoRaWAN protocol versions from 1.0.1 onwards.

5. Power Consumption:
In terms of power consumption, BROWAN is a low-energy device powered by batteries, designed to last for multiple years, depending on the frequency of sound measurement and data transmission. It enters a sleep mode when not measuring or transmitting data, further reducing power consumption.

6. Use Cases:
BROWAN finds usage in various domains:
   i. Industrial Plants: Monitors noise levels to ensure they are within allowable limits for worker safety.
  ii. Smart Cities: Measures ambient noise for maintaining a sound pollution check.
 iii. Health Care Facilities: Ensures a peaceful environment for patient recovery.
  iv. Schools and Offices: Monitors noise levels to maintain an conducive environment for work or study.

7. Limitations:
Although BROWAN is a versatile sensor, it has certain limitations:
   i. It may not detect very low-frequency sounds or above the audible frequency range.
  ii. The accuracy might be influenced by factors such as temperature, humidity, and wind.
 iii. In some instances, it may require a clear path (lack of obstructions) between the sensor and the LoRaWAN gateway for effective signal transmission.

This documentation is meant to provide users with a better understanding of the working principles, installation process, and overall potential of the BROWAN Sound Level sensor. For further technical support, it is recommended that users refer to the individual device manual or manufacturer's customer support.
