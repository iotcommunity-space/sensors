## BROWAN - Industrial Tracker (BROWAN) Overview

### Working Principles
The BROWAN Industrial Tracker leverages modern IoT and LoRaWAN technologies to provide real-time location tracking and condition monitoring services. The tracker operates using various sensors including GPS, accelerometer, and gyroscope to monitor location and movement. 

It communicates information about the tracked object to a main server or control center via LoRaWAN. This information can be accessed in real-time to monitor the position of an asset, its movements, and other conditions. The data is processed and visualized on a user-friendly interface, making it easy to understand and interpret.

### Installation Guide
The BROWAN Tracker is straightforward to install:

1. Mount the tracker on the asset you wish to monitor using appropriate mounting hardware.
2. Connect the tracker to a power source if necessary.
3. Register the tracker's unique identification number on your tracking platform.
4. Install the LoRaWAN gateway if it is not already set up.
5. Pair the tracker to your LoRaWAN network and register it to your tracking platform.
6. Validate successful installation by locating the asset on your tracking platform.

### LoRaWAN Details
LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) is a network protocol designed for long-range communication at a low power. BROWAN utilizes this technology allowing for data transfer over large distances without consuming much power. This makes it highly suited to industrial IoT applications where assets may be dispersed over large areas. It provides great penetration in urban or industrial environments, allowing the trackers to send their data even in challenging conditions.

### Power Consumption
The power consumption of the BROWAN tracker is minimal due to the low-power operation of LoRaWAN. Depending on the configuration and use case, the battery life can last for several years. However, factors such as the update rate, signal strength, and activity can affect power consumption.

### Use Cases
The BROWAN Tracker finds myriad applications such as:

1. **Asset Tracking**: Tracking valuable assets in real-time to prevent loss or theft.
2. **Fleet Management**: Monitoring the location and movements of vehicles.
3. **Supply Chain Monitoring**: Tracking and monitoring products or assets throughout the supply chain.
4. **Smart Cities**: Monitoring city assets such as waste management bins, maintenance vehicles, etc.

### Limitations
While the BROWAN Industrial Tracker provides powerful capabilities, a few limitations exist:

1. **Dependent on LoRaWAN**: The tracker wholly depends on the LoRaWAN network. If coverage is limited or nonexistent, the tracker might not function effectively.
2. **Limited Data Rate**: LoRaWAN is designed for low power, not high data rates. Hence, it may not be suitable for applications that require the frequent transmission of large amounts of data.
3. **Indoor/Underground Limitations**: While LoRaWAN has good penetration, it may not always be effective in reaching indoor or underground assets.
4. **Less Effective without GPS**: In areas where a GPS signal is not available, the tracker might not accurately determine the assetâ€™s location.
