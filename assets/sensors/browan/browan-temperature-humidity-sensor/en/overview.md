## Technical Overview of BROWAN - Temperature Humidity Sensor

### Working Principles

The BROWAN Temperature Humidity Sensor utilizes highly accurate sensors to measure ambient temperature and humidity levels. The sensor operates on the principle of capacitive humidity sensing combined with a thermistor for temperature measurement. The capacitive humidity sensor relies on changes in the dielectric constant of a hygroscopic polymer film laid between two conductive plates. As humidity levels fluctuate, the capacitance changes and is converted into a corresponding humidity reading. In tandem, the thermistor determines temperature variations, providing reliable data suited for environmental monitoring.

### Installation Guide

1. **Site Selection**: Choose a location that is representative of the area where monitoring is required, typically avoiding direct exposure to sunlight, excessive dust, or sources of moisture not indicative of the broader environment.

2. **Mounting**: The sensor can be mounted using screws or double-sided adhesive tape, ensuring it is securely positioned to avoid tampering or accidental dislocation. It's typically wall or pole-mounted for optimal results.

3. **Powering the Sensor**: Install the batteries (usually 2 x AA lithium or alkaline) ensuring correct polarity. Verify power status through the device's LED indicators or app interface.

4. **Activation**: Activate the sensor using the manufacturer’s guidelines, typically involving a button press sequence or activation via the manufacturer’s application.

5. **Configuration**: Configure sensor settings through mobile app or web interface associated with the sensor for necessary intervals, threshold alerts, and connection to a LoRaWAN network if not automatically linked.

6. **Testing**: Once installed and configured, perform a functional test to ensure accurate readings and transmission.

### LoRaWAN Details

The BROWAN Temperature Humidity Sensor is equipped to communicate via LoRaWAN, a Low Power Wide Area Network protocol designed for the Internet of Things (IoT). The sensor transmits its data to a central server using LoRa frequencies. Key features include:

- **Frequency Bands**: Typically operates on ISM bands (e.g., EU868, US915, AS920) compliant with local regulatory standards.
- **Communication Range**: Depending on the environment, capable of reaching distances from 2 up to 15 kilometers.
- **Security**: Data encryption using AES-128 networks ensuring secure transmissions.
- **Activation**: Supports both Over-the-Air Activation (OTAA) and Activation by Personalization (ABP) methods for device connection to networks.

### Power Consumption

The sensor is designed for low-power operation to extend battery life, making it ideal for remote monitoring. Key aspects include:

- **Battery Life**: Estimated between 5 to 10 years, reliant on reporting interval and environmental conditions (fields of use).
- **Sleep Mode**: The sensor remains in ultra-low power sleep mode, awakening periodically or upon set thresholds to send data.
- **Reporting Interval**: Configurable, typically ranges from 5 minutes to 24 hours to conserve energy according to user requirements. 

### Use Cases

1. **Agriculture**: Soil and environment monitoring for optimizing irrigation.
2. **Building Automation**: Climate control within smart buildings.
3. **Cold Chain Monitoring**: Ensuring the integrity of temperature-sensitive goods.
4. **Environmental Monitoring**: Logging data for weather stations in environmental research.
5. **Greenhouse Management**: Automated control of temperature and humidity for optimal plant growth.

### Limitations

1. **Signal Interference**: Thick walls or metal structures may limit LoRaWAN communication range and effectiveness.
2. **Calibration**: Periodic calibration might be necessary for consistent long-term accuracy.
3. **Battery Dependency**: Sensor functionality is reliant on battery condition; drained batteries require timely replacement.
4. **Environmental Impact**: Extreme conditions beyond operational specifications may lead to sensor failure or inaccurate readings.
5. **Data Latency**: Due to network constraints and long reporting intervals to conserve power, data may not be real-time.

Overall, the BROWAN Temperature Humidity Sensor is well-suited to diverse IoT applications requiring reliable, long-term environmental monitoring with minimal maintenance.
