## Overview â€“ BROWAN - Door and Window Sensor (BROWAN)

The BROWAN Door and Window Sensor is a practical IoT device that monitors the status of doors and windows, providing real-time insights via LoRaWAN technology. Its operating principle revolves around the detection of contact between two magnetic entities to determine if a door or window is open or closed. 

## Working Principles

Empowered by the generic Contact Sensor API, the BROWAN sensor transmits information about the opening or closing of a door/window through the IoT LoRaWAN network. It employs a magnetic switch (reed switch) that opens or closes depending on the proximity of another magnet. This switch triggers a signal when the status changes, enabling accurate and timely monitoring.

## Installation Guide

Installation primarily involves placing the sensor on the door or window frame and the magnet on the moving part of the door or window. When the door or window opens, the magnet moves away from the sensor, triggering the sensor to send an alert via the LoRaWAN network.

## LoRaWAN Details

The device supports LoRaWAN 1.0.2 protocol, allowing for extended range communication with minimal power consumption. The device operates in multiple LoRaWAN frequency bands, tailored to the specific region in which it is deployed.

## Power Consumption

The power efficiency of the BROWAN sensor focuses on long-term use with minimum maintenance. Its battery life is optimized for over 2 years (with 30 open/close cycles per day), powered by a 400mAh 3V lithium battery.

## Use Cases

1. Home Security: Deploy the BROWAN sensor to enhance security by monitoring the status of doors/windows.
2. Facility Management: Use in offices, warehouses, or industrial sites to keep track of the access to restricted areas.
3. Elderly Care: For elder care facilities or homes with elders, it can aid in tracking unusual activities like night wandering.

## Limitations

1. Sensor Placement: The sensor and magnet must be properly aligned and the gap between them should not be too large. Misalignment or a large gap may lead to ineffective operation.
2. LoRaWAN Coverage: The sensor requires a good LoRaWAN network signal for the efficient transmission of data. Without stable network coverage, it might fail to report the status of doors and windows.
3. Battery Dependency: The device is dependent on battery power. The lifespan of the battery might vary based on the number of daily transmissions.

Despite these limitations, the BROWAN Door and Window Sensor is an efficient and user-friendly device highly beneficial for real-time monitoring of door and window statuses across various applications.
