## BROWAN Object Locator - Technical Overview

## Working principle

The BROWAN Object Locator is an intelligent IoT device designed to provide real-time, seamless tracking and locating of critical objects. The sensor operates based on the LoRaWAN technology and offers a broad array of positioning technology such as WiFi, BLE, and GPS.

By leveraging the Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) connectivity, BROWAN collects and sends relevant data to a centralized location over low-power, long-range networks, providing essential data points to recognize, monitor, and locate the objects. 

## Installation Guide

1. Attach the Object Locator to the object meant to be tracked.
2. Activate the device and connect it to your IoT infrastructure by registering it to the network via the LoRaWAN gateway.
3. After registration, configure the tracker with your tracking parameters such as update intervals.
4. Use the BROWAN app or a tailored solution to monitor the object's location.

## LoRaWAN Details

BROWAN Object Locator supports various LoRaWAN regional parameters like EU868, US915, AU915, AS923, and others. It benefits from all the advantageous properties of the LoRaWAN protocol: low power consumption, secure communication, wide area coverage, and capacity to handle a large number of connected devices.

## Power Consumption

The power consumption of the object locator is exceptionally low and optimized for battery-powered operations to extend the assetâ€™s life. Its in-built, high-capacity 2 AAA alkaline batteries ensure long-lasting deployment with periodic reporting.

## Use cases

1. **Asset tracking:** The BROWAN Object Locator is an ideal solution for inventory management and tracking requirements in warehouses, logistics, and supply chain operations.
   
2. **Personal belongings:** It can be used for locating personal objects like cars, bikes, and even pets.

3. **Fleet management:** The locator is excellent for tracking and managing fleet movement and ensuring transportation efficiency and safety.

## Limitations

1. Although the BROWAN Object Locator is designed to cover extensive areas, the range can still be a limiting factor based on the quality of the LoRaWAN network and environmental conditions.

2. The accuracy of GPS tracking may vary, which could impact the precision of object location.

3. It requires a LoRaWAN connectivity, which might not be available in all regions.

4. Battery life can vary depending on the operating environment and reporting frequency.
