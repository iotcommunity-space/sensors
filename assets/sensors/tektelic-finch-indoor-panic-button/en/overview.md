## Technical Overview of TEKTELIC - Finch Indoor Panic Button

### Product Description

The TEKTELIC Finch Indoor Panic Button is a compact and discrete solution designed for emergency alert and communication within indoor environments. It utilizes LoRaWAN connectivity to ensure low-power, long-range communication ideal for large facilities such as hospitals, schools, and office buildings.

### Working Principles

The Finch Panic Button operates by detecting manual activation. When pressed, the button sends an immediate alarm through the LoRaWAN network to a central monitoring system. This wireless transmission is facilitated by LoRaWAN's inherent capabilities for low-power, long-range communication, ensuring that alerts are transmitted reliably even from challenging indoor environments. The device also includes an LED indicator to provide visual confirmation of activation to the user.

### Installation Guide

1. **Site Selection:** Choose an accessible and visible location for the button to ensure that it can be quickly reached in case of an emergency.
   
2. **Mounting:** The Finch Panic Button comes with a mounting kit that can be affixed to a variety of surfaces including walls and furniture. Use the provided screws or adhesive backing for installation.

3. **Configuration:** Once mounted, configure the device to the local LoRaWAN network using the user manual instructions. This typically involves scanning a QR code or inputting device identifiers (DevEUI, AppEUI, and AppKey) into the network server.

4. **Testing:** After installation, conduct a full system test to ensure that pressing the button results in an alert being properly received by the central monitoring system.

### LoRaWAN Details

- **Frequency Bands:** The Finch Panic Button is compatible with multiple frequency bands, including EU868, US915, and AS923, allowing for global deployment.
- **Activation Mode:** Supports both OTAA (Over-The-Air Activation) and ABP (Activation by Personalization) for secure network joining.
- **Data Rate & Range:** Employs adaptive data rate modulation to optimize power consumption and maintain connectivity across distances, with practical indoor ranges typically ranging from hundreds of meters up to several kilometers, depending on the environment.

### Power Consumption

The Finch Panic Button is designed for ultra-low power consumption, allowing it to operate on a single battery for extended periods (up to several years), depending on usage. It typically utilizes a replaceable CR2450 coin cell battery, minimizing the need for frequent maintenance.

### Use Cases

1. **Healthcare Facilities:** Enables patients and staff to quickly signal alerts for assistance in hospitals or nursing homes.
   
2. **Educational Institutions:** Provides students and faculty a rapid means to alert security in case of emergencies like intruder threats.
   
3. **Corporate Offices:** Allows employees a mechanism to silently notify security teams of emergencies or security breaches.

4. **Retail Spaces:** Enhances customer safety by providing panic alerts in changing rooms or remote areas of the store.

### Limitations

- **Signal Range Limitation:** While LoRaWAN provides excellent coverage, heavily obstructed environments like underground basements or buildings with thick concrete walls may impede signal transmission.
   
- **Network Dependency:** The button relies on an active LoRaWAN network; outages or disruptions in network service may affect critical alert delivery.
   
- **Battery Dependency:** Although the device is low-powered, it is reliant on its battery. Failure to replace the battery upon depleting may result in non-functionality.
   
- **Limited Two-Way Communication:** The Finch Panic Button is designed primarily for sending alerts and does not support complex two-way communication or real-time interaction beyond simple acknowledgment.

The TEKTELIC Finch Indoor Panic Button embodies a blend of simplicity, reliability, and technological efficiency, making it a vital component for enhancing safety and responsiveness in various indoor settings.
