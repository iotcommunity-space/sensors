### Technical Overview of ELLENEX - Pdt2 L Sensor

The ELLENEX - Pdt2 L is a robust, high-performance pressure and temperature sensor designed for integration into various industrial IoT environments. By leveraging the LoRaWAN communication protocol, it provides reliable, long-range data transmission for monitoring applications across diverse sectors.

#### Working Principles

The ELLENEX - Pdt2 L utilizes piezoresistive sensor technology to measure pressure and employs a precision temperature sensor for accurate thermal data. These sensors are integrated into a compact, weatherproof enclosure that protects against harsh environmental conditions. Pressure measurements are obtained by detecting changes in resistance caused by applied pressure on a diaphragm, while temperature is measured using a thermistor or RTD located within the sensor module.

#### Installation Guide

1. **Site Preparation**: Determine the mounting location, ensuring that the sensor is appropriately positioned to avoid physical damage and exposure to extreme conditions beyond specified limits.

2. **Mounting**: The sensor should be mounted using the appropriate hardware. Vertical mounting is recommended to minimize potential drift due to temperature gradients or sediment deposits.

3. **Wiring**: Connect the sensor to the power source and other necessary interfaces. Ensure all connections are secure and weatherproof to prevent ingress of moisture or contaminants.

4. **Configuration**: Utilize the configuration software to set sensor parameters such as measurement intervals, data transmission frequency, and network settings.

5. **Calibration**: Perform a calibration check to ensure accuracy, using a pressure and temperature source traceable to a certified standard.

6. **Connectivity Check**: Register the device on the LoRaWAN network server and verify successful data transmission.

#### LoRaWAN Details

- **Frequency Bands**: Operates in standard LoRaWAN frequencies (e.g., EU868, US915), compatible with regional ISM band requirements.
- **Network Join Method**: Supports Over-the-Air Activation (OTAA) for secure network joining.
- **Data Transmission**: Configurable uplink rate from minutes to hours, supporting both standard and tailored payloads following LoRaWAN specs.
- **Range**: Communication range can extend up to several kilometers in line-of-sight conditions, subject to environmental factors.

#### Power Consumption

The Pdt2 L sensor is battery-powered, optimized for low power consumption to support long-term deployments. Average power consumption is maintained below 10 µA during sleep mode and typically peaks at around 25 mA during data transmission, depending on the frequency of data reporting and network conditions. The device is equipped with a high-capacity lithium battery, offering several years of operation before needing replacement.

#### Use Cases

- **Water Resource Management**: Monitor water storage levels, pipeline pressure, and environmental conditions in reservoirs, lakes, and oceans.
- **Industrial Automation**: Integrate into manufacturing systems to optimize plant efficiency by monitoring pressure and temperature in pipes and tanks.
- **Agricultural Applications**: Manage irrigation systems, monitor soil conditions, and track environmental changes in real-time to enhance crop yields.
- **Oil and Gas Industry**: Monitor wellhead conditions, pipeline pressure, and environmental compliance to ensure safety and efficiency.

#### Limitations

- **Environment**: Extreme temperature variations beyond specified operating conditions (-40°C to +85°C) can affect sensor accuracy and lifespan.
- **Physical Impact**: Although robust, the sensor may be susceptible to mechanical damage if exposed to direct impact or excessive pressure beyond its maximum rating.
- **Network Dependency**: The effectiveness of data transmission relies on the availability and quality of the LoRaWAN network, which may be limited in remote areas or shielded environments.
- **Battery Life**: While designed for long-term use, power consumption can be significantly influenced by frequent data transmissions, leading to faster battery depletion.

Overall, the ELLENEX - Pdt2 L offers a reliable solution for various industrial monitoring applications, with a balance of advanced features and potential constraints. Proper installation, regular calibration, and consideration of environmental conditions are essential for optimized performance.
