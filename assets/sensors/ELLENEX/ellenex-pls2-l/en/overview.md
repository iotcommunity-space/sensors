### Technical Overview: ELLENEX - Pls2 L

The ELLENEX - Pls2 L is a precise low-power pressure and level sensor tailored for industrial IoT applications. This device is primarily known for its robustness in monitoring liquid levels in harsh environments while leveraging the advantages of LoRaWAN technology for efficient data transmission. Below is a detailed overview covering its working principles, installation, technical specifications, and more.

#### Working Principles

The Pls2 L sensor utilizes a piezoresistive pressure sensor to determine liquid levels. The principle of operation is based on measuring the hydrostatic pressure exerted by the liquid column above the sensor. When submerged, the sensor detects the pressure at a specific point, and from this data, it calculates the liquid level by compensating for factors like atmospheric pressure and temperature variations.

#### Installation Guide

1. **Site Selection**: Choose a location where the sensor will remain submerged and where potential interferences like turbulence or obstructions are minimal.

2. **Mounting**: 
   - Submerge the sensor vertically in the liquid medium ensuring the cable gland is above the highest anticipated liquid level.
   - Use the manufacturer-supplied weights and fixtures to stabilize the sensor position and minimize motion.

3. **Cable Routing**: Securely route the cable away from sharp edges and high-traffic areas. Ensure there is enough slack to accommodate any movement of the liquid surface.

4. **Connection**: Connect the sensor cable to the data logger or LoRaWAN node. Double-check all connections for unity and integrity.

5. **Calibration**: 
   - After installation, the sensor may require initial calibration to ensure accurate readings.
   - Perform this by comparing sensor readings with known reference points.

#### LoRaWAN Details

- **Frequency Bands**: The Pls2 L is compatible with global ISM bands: EU868, US915, AS923, etc., accommodating a wide range of regional requirements.
- **Network Membership**: Ensures secure and efficient data transmission via Over-the-Air (OTA) activation or Activation by Personalization (ABP).
- **Data Rate & Spread Factor**: Supports adaptive data rates (ADR) which dynamically change the data spread factor based on network conditions to optimize battery life and efficiency.
- **Payload & Transmission**: Typical payload can include pressure, temperature, and battery status data, transmitted at user-configurable intervals.

#### Power Consumption

The ELLENEX - Pls2 L is designed for ultra-low power operation, ideal for remote monitoring:

- **Power Source**: The device is powered by internal batteries that provide long operational life, supported by low-power design to maximize energy efficiency.
- **Consumption**: In sleep mode, the device consumes minimal power, only activating high-energy processes like transmission when necessary, extending battery life to several years under typical usage conditions.

#### Use Cases

- **Water Level Monitoring**: Ideal for reservoirs, rivers, and tanks where real-time liquid level measurement is crucial.
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Used in wetlands or flood-prone areas to monitor water levels and trigger alerts.
- **Industrial Applications**: Suitable for managing liquid inventories in industrial settings and preventing overflow in storage tanks.

#### Limitations

- **Installation Environment**: The sensor can face challenges in highly turbulent or rapidly fluctuating environments, which may temporarily affect measurement stability.
- **Medium Compatibility**: It is most effective with non-corrosive liquids. Usage in corrosive mediums may require additional protective measures.
- **LoRaWAN Signal Dependency**: Requires stable LoRaWAN network coverage for reliable data transmission. Poor network landscapes might necessitate additional gateway setups.

### Conclusion

The ELLENEX - Pls2 L is a robust solution that provides accurate and reliable measurements for a wide range of liquid level monitoring needs, leveraging LoRaWAN for efficient IoT integration. Proper installation and awareness of environmental limitations can maximize its effectiveness in diverse industrial and environmental conditions.
