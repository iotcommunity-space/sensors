### Technical Overview: ELLENEX - Pls3 L Sensor

The ELLENEX - Pls3 L is a precision pressure, level, and temperature sensor designed for IoT applications, integrating seamlessly with LoRaWAN networks. This sensor is tailored for remote monitoring environments where extending battery life and data reliability are critical.

#### Working Principles

The ELLENEX - Pls3 L sensor leverages piezoresistive technology to measure pressure and capacitive technology for level sensing. It integrates a highly accurate temperature sensor to complement its measurements. These elements allow the sensor to provide comprehensive environmental data, useful for a wide range of applications including fluid level monitoring and industrial process control.

Upon installation, the sensor continuously measures pressure, level, and temperature data, which is digitized and processed within its internal processor. The processed data is then transmitted over a LoRaWAN network, enabling long-range communication with minimal power consumption.

#### Installation Guide

1. **Site Assessment**: Evaluate the installation site for optimal signal reception and sensor deployment. Ensure there is no obstructions or interference that might affect the LoRaWAN signal.

2. **Mounting**: 
   - Securely mount the sensor using the provided brackets or coupling units, ensuring the sensor is aligned properly for accurate level measurement.
   - For submersible applications, confirm that the sensor depth is within its specified operational range.

3. **Electrical Connections**:
   - The sensor operates on a replaceable battery system; ensure the battery is properly installed and has sufficient charge for initial use.
   - Ensure all connections are secure and sealed to prevent moisture ingress.

4. **Configuration**:
   - Use the ELLENEX configuration tool to set sensor parameters such as measurement intervals, threshold settings, and alert notifications.
   - Register the sensor on your LoRaWAN network by entering the device's EUI and other necessary credentials into your LoRaWAN network server.

5. **Calibration**:
   - Perform a calibration check using known baseline conditions to ensure the sensor is providing accurate readings.
   - Re-calibrate as necessary during routine maintenance checks.

#### LoRaWAN Details

- **Frequency Band**: The Pls3 L operates in standard ISM bands, compatible with various regional frequencies (e.g., EU868, US915).
- **Transmission Range**: The sensor can transmit data over distances up to 10 km in rural areas and 3 km in urban environments, depending on network conditions.
- **Data Rate**: Supports several data rates (ranging from SF7 to SF12), allowing for a trade-off between range and data throughput.
- **Activation**: Supports both Over-the-Air Activation (OTAA) and Activation by Personalization (ABP) for flexible network integration.

#### Power Consumption

The ELLENEX - Pls3 L is engineered for energy efficiency, typically drawing an average current of < 15 ÂµA in standby mode and approximately 100 mA during data transmission. Utilizing an internal long-life lithium battery, it is designed to operate for up to 10 years under normal conditions, depending on reporting frequency and environmental factors.

#### Use Cases

- **Water Resource Management**: Monitoring reservoir levels, river flows, and groundwater levels for accurate water resource management.
- **Industrial Process Control**: Managing and monitoring process levels and pressures in chemical, oil, and gas industries.
- **Agricultural Applications**: Monitoring irrigation systems to optimize water usage based on actual environmental conditions.

#### Limitations

- **Environmental Sensitivity**: Although robust, it is imperative that the sensor is installed in environments within its specified temperature and pressure ranges to avoid erroneous readings or sensor failure.
- **Signal Interference**: Dense urban environments, or those with heavy electromagnetic interference, might impede LoRaWAN signal performance, necessitating network adjustments or repeaters.
- **Battery Life Considerations**: Frequent data transmission intervals can decrease battery lifetime, necessitating a balance between data frequency and power consumption.

The ELLENEX - Pls3 L provides a reliable, low-maintenance solution for remote monitoring applications, offering robust data accuracy and network versatility, making it an excellent choice for industrial IoT deployments.
