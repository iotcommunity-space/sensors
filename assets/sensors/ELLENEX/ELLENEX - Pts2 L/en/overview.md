# Technical Overview: ELLENEX - Pts2 L

The ELLENEX - Pts2 L is a sophisticated IoT-enabled pressure and temperature sensor designed for various industrial and environmental monitoring applications. This sensor leverages LoRaWAN technology for wireless communication, providing long-range data transmission with low power consumption, making it suitable for remote and challenging environments.

### Working Principles

The ELLENEX - Pts2 L operates by measuring the pressure and temperature of the medium it is installed in. It utilizes a piezoresistive pressure sensor and a thermistor to measure these physical quantities accurately. The sensor captures the analog signals, which are then converted to digital form using a built-in microcontroller. Once processed, the data are transmitted via LoRaWAN to a gateway, enabling remote monitoring and data logging.

### Installation Guide

1. **Site Selection:**
   - Choose a location that is representative of the area or parameter you aim to measure. The site should be free of extreme electromagnetic interference.

2. **Mounting:**
   - Install the sensor using the provided brackets or flanges. Ensure that the sensor's mechanical connection is secure and leak-free, particularly in pressurized environments.

3. **Power Connection:**
   - Connect the sensor to its power supply. The Pts2 L requires a 3.6 V lithium battery, which is user-replaceable. Ensure connections are corrosion-free and tightly secured.

4. **Configuration:**
   - Use the ELLENEX configuration software to set up the sensor's parameters, such as data transmission intervals, LoRaWAN settings, and calibration adjustments. This may involve connecting the sensor via USB or wirelessly, depending on model specifications.

5. **Network Connection:**
   - Ensure the sensor is within range of a LoRaWAN gateway. Configure the device to join the network using its unique DevEUI, AppEUI, and AppKey provided with the device.

### LoRaWAN Details

- **Frequency Bands:** The ELLENEX Pts2 L supports several LoRaWAN frequency bands, including 868 MHz (EU), 915 MHz (US), and others, depending on regional regulations.
- **Network Compatibility:** It is compatible with most LoRaWAN gateways and network servers, supporting both private and public network deployments.
- **Data Rates:** Supports multiple data rates (DR0 to DR5 in EU), adapting to the distance and environmental conditions to optimize transmission efficiency.
- **Security:** Implements standard LoRaWAN security features, including end-to-end encryption and secure key exchange.

### Power Consumption

The Pts2 L is engineered for low power consumption, primarily when operating in a periodic or event-triggered mode. Battery life can exceed several years under typical conditions, with battery longevity influenced by sampling intervals, transmission power levels, and ambient environmental conditions.

### Use Cases

- **Industrial Process Monitoring:** The sensor is ideal for monitoring pressure and temperature in pipelines, tanks, and other critical infrastructure.
- **Environmental Monitoring:** Useful in applications such as water quality monitoring, hydrology, and climatology, where regular, remote data collection is necessary.
- **Smart Agriculture:** Utilized for irrigation systems to monitor soil conditions, ensuring efficient water resource management.

### Limitations

- **Range Limitations:** The effective communication range can vary greatly depending on environmental factors such as obstacles, line-of-sight, and other signal interferences.
- **Battery Constraints:** While designed for low power operation, continuous high-frequency data transmission will reduce battery life.
- **Environmental Conditions:** The sensor should not be exposed to conditions that exceed its specified operational temperature and pressure limits. Harsh environments (e.g., highly corrosive or extreme temperatures) can impact sensor longevity and readings.
- **Data Latency:** Depending on the LoRaWAN network configuration, there may be delays in data transmission which could affect real-time monitoring applications.

In summary, the ELLENEX - Pts2 L is a versatile sensor for pressure and temperature measurement in a variety of settings. Its robust design, combined with LoRaWAN connectivity, makes it an excellent choice for telemetry applications where remote monitoring and low power consumption are required.
