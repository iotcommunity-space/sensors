### Technical Overview of ELLENEX - Fms2 L

#### Introduction
The ELLENEX Fms2 L is a sophisticated fluid-level monitoring sensor designed for seamless integration into IoT systems, utilizing LoRaWAN communication technology. Specifically crafted for hydrostatic pressure level measurement, this sensor is ideal for applications requiring accurate fluid monitoring in environments such as water reservoirs, tanks, and other fluid storage facilities.

#### Working Principles
The Fms2 L operates on the principle of hydrostatic pressure measurement. It measures the pressure exerted by the fluid column directly above the sensor, which is proportional to the fluid level. Utilizing MEMS or piezoelectric sensing technology, the sensor converts pressure data into electrical signals calibrated into fluid level metrics. The output signals are transmitted wirelessly via LoRaWAN, enabling remote monitoring and seamless data integration.

#### Installation Guide
1. **Site Preparation**: Choose a suitable installation site free from obstructions and where the sensor can remain submerged at all times.
2. **Mounting**: Secure the sensor using stainless steel clamps or brackets. Ensure that the sensor is mounted vertically and securely to prevent it from being dislodged by fluid currents.
3. **Wiring and Connections**: For sensors with external power sources, connect the power cables according to the polarity markings. Ensure that any connections are secure and waterproof.
4. **Configuration**: Utilize the accompanying software or mobile app to configure the LoRaWAN settings, including frequency, DevEUI, AppEUI, and AppKey, to ensure seamless integration into your existing network.

#### LoRaWAN Details
- **Frequency Band**: Designed to work on various bands depending on the regional specifications including EU868, US915, AS923, etc.
- **Data Rate**: Supports adaptive data rate (ADR) to optimize the sensor's communication efficiency.
- **Payload**: Compact payload format to ensure efficient data transmission, typically transmitting level data and sensor health status periodically.
- **Security**: Implements end-to-end encryption using AES-128 to secure data integrity and confidentiality.

#### Power Consumption
The Fms2 L is optimized for low power consumption, facilitating extended battery life. Utilizing advanced sleep-wake cycles, power utilization is minimized while ensuring timely data sampling and reporting. In typical configurations, the sensor can operate for approximately 5-10 years on its internal battery, depending on usage conditions and transmission intervals.

#### Use Cases
- **Water Management**: Monitoring water levels in reservoirs, rivers, and canals to aid in water resource management.
- **Industrial Tanks**: Measuring fluid levels in fuel, chemical, and water tanks for industrial process management.
- **Flood Monitoring**: Providing real-time data for flood detection and early warning systems in vulnerable areas.
- **Smart Agriculture**: Assisting in irrigation control by monitoring water levels in agricultural ponds and tanks.

#### Limitations
- **Installation Depth**: The sensor must remain submerged at all times, limiting its use in applications where fluctuating water levels fall below the sensor's position.
- **Signal Range**: While LoRaWAN offers extended range, physical obstructions and environmental factors can affect transmission distance.
- **Temperature Sensitivity**: Extreme temperatures may affect the sensor's accuracy and battery performance.
- **Calibration Requirement**: Periodic calibration may be necessary to maintain accuracy, especially in environments with varying fluid densities.

The ELLENEX Fms2 L, with its robust design and reliable LoRaWAN connectivity, offers a powerful solution for fluid level monitoring across various applications. However, careful consideration of installation environment and regular maintenance is essential to maximize its potential.
