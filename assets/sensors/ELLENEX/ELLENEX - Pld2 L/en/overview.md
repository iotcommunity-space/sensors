### Technical Overview: ELLENEX - Pld2 L

The ELLENEX - Pld2 L is a state-of-the-art pressure level sensor designed specifically for remote monitoring applications in fluid and environmental management systems. Its integration with LoRaWAN technology allows for wireless transmission over long distances, making it ideal for applications where traditional wired installations are not feasible.

#### Working Principles

The ELLENEX - Pld2 L operates on the principle of hydrostatic pressure measurement to determine liquid levels. It employs a piezoresistive pressure sensor element to measure the pressure exerted by the fluid column above the sensor. The sensor then converts this pressure into an electrical signal, which is processed and transmitted using LoRaWAN communication protocols. It is designed for submersion in liquids, typically installed at the bottom of tanks or wells.

#### Installation Guide

1. **Site Preparation:**
   - Ensure that the environment is compatible with the sensor specifications, particularly concerning chemical compatibility and temperature ranges.
   - Identify a suitable installation point where the sensor can be fully submerged without obstruction or the risk of physical damage.

2. **Physical Installation:**
   - Secure the sensor at the bottom of the tank or well using appropriate mounting hardware to prevent movement.
   - Avoid placing the sensor near inlet streams to ensure accurate readings.

3. **Wiring and Connectivity:**
   - Route the sensor cable to its connected data acquisition unit or power source while avoiding sharp bends or potential rubbing points that could damage the cable.
   - Ensure proper grounding and isolation to prevent interference from electrical noise.

4. **Calibration:**
   - Perform initial calibration as per the manufacturerâ€™s specifications, taking into account the specific gravity of the liquid being monitored.

5. **Commissioning:**
   - Connect the sensor to the local LoRaWAN network by inputting the necessary network credentials (such as DevEUI, AppEUI, and AppKey).
   - Verify proper data transmission by checking availability on the network's interface.

#### LoRaWAN Details

- **Frequency Bands:** The sensor supports standard LoRaWAN frequency bands such as EU868, US915, AS923, etc., based on regional requirements.
- **Network Topology:** Utilizes a Star-of-Stars topology, enabling communication over distances of up to 15 km (line of sight).
- **Data Transmission:** Supports Class A and Class C device classes for periodic and continuous data transmission scenarios.
- **Security:** Implements end-to-end encryption (AES 128) for secure data transfer.

#### Power Consumption

- **Power Supply:** The device operates on a long-life lithium battery.
- **Battery Life:** Typically ranges between 5 to 10 years, depending on data transmission frequency and environmental conditions.
- **Energy Efficiency:** Equipped with a low-power MCU that minimizes energy consumption during idle periods, significantly extending battery life.

#### Use Cases

1. **Water Tank Monitoring:** Provides real-time water level data for urban water management and agricultural irrigation systems.
2. **Groundwater Level Monitoring:** Suitable for environmental surveys and hydrogeology studies.
3. **Flood Monitoring Systems:** Essential for early warning systems in flood-prone areas.
4. **Remote Reservoir Management:** Enables efficient management of remote reservoirs and ponds without human intervention.

#### Limitations

- **Accuracy Constraints:** Performance can be affected by extreme temperatures, rapid pressure changes, or air entrapment in the liquid.
- **Network Dependency:** Relies on the availability and reliability of the LoRaWAN network infrastructure.
- **Maintenance Requirements:** Periodic recalibration and battery replacement may be necessary to ensure long-term accuracy and reliability.
- **Installation Depth:** Limited by cable length and pressure rating; installations beyond the specified depth may impact sensor performance.

The ELLENEX - Pld2 L offers robust solutions for complex monitoring needs across a variety of terrains and conditions. By leveraging LoRaWAN technology, it delivers reliable, far-reaching communication that complements modern IoT ecosystems.
