### Technical Overview of ELLENEX - Plm2 L

The ELLENEX - Plm2 L sensor is an advanced IoT device designed for remote monitoring of liquid levels in various industrial applications. Leveraging LoRaWAN technology, it offers long-range, low-power communication capabilities, making it ideal for deployments in large areas or hard-to-reach locations.

#### Working Principles

The Plm2 L sensor operates on the principles of hydrostatic pressure measurement. It is equipped with a high-precision pressure transducer that detects the pressure exerted by the liquid column above the sensor. This pressure is directly proportional to the liquid level, allowing the device to accurately determine the liquid's height in a container or tank. The sensor then converts this measurement into a digital signal, which is transmitted over long distances via LoRaWAN.

#### Installation Guide

1. **Site Preparation:**
   - Identify an optimal location for sensor placement, ensuring that it is fully submerged at the deepest point of the tank or vessel.
   - Ensure there are no obstructions that could interfere with signal transmission.

2. **Mounting:**
   - Securely mount the sensor using the provided hardware, ensuring that it is stable and well aligned.
   - Connect the sensor cable to a suitable junction box if necessary, avoiding any sharp bends or kinks in the cable.

3. **Connectivity:**
   - Configure the device for LoRaWAN network integration using the manufacturer-provided software tool.
   - Ensure the device is registered with the desired LoRaWAN network provider.

4. **Calibration:**
   - Perform an initial calibration in a known fluid condition, as per the manufacturer's guidelines, to ensure accurate readings.

5. **Power Management:**
   - Install batteries according to the manufacturer's specifications, and ensure proper sealing to maintain device integrity.

#### LoRaWAN Details

- **Frequency Bands:** The Plm2 L supports a variety of frequency bands (EU868, US915, AS923, etc.), conforming to regional regulatory requirements.
- **Data Rate:** It uses Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) technology to optimize data communication based on link quality.
- **Network Protocol:** Complies with LoRaWAN specification 1.0.3 or higher.
- **Security:** Implements end-to-end encryption (AES-128) for secure data transmission.

#### Power Consumption

The Plm2 L is designed for low power consumption, primarily operating in sleep mode until measurements are taken or data needs to be transmitted. Average power consumption is minimal, with a typical battery life exceeding 5 years, depending on the reporting interval and environmental conditions. The device employs energy-efficient components to sustain long operational periods without requiring frequent maintenance.

#### Use Cases

- **Water Resource Management:** Monitoring levels in reservoirs, lakes, and rivers to prevent overflow or detect drought conditions.
- **Industrial Tanks:** Managing liquid inventory in chemical or food processing industries.
- **Waste Management:** Tracking liquid levels in sewage or waste tanks to prevent overflows.
- **Agriculture:** Managing irrigation systems by monitoring water levels in storage tanks.

#### Limitations

- **Installation Depth:** The sensor can only operate effectively within its specified pressure range, typically up to 10 meters of water column pressure. Beyond this, accuracy may degrade.
- **Environmental Conditions:** Although robust, extreme temperatures can affect sensor performance and battery life.
- **Signal Obstruction:** Dense building materials or significant underground installations can impede LoRaWAN signal coverage.
- **Maintenance Access:** In some installations, accessing the sensor for maintenance can be challenging due to environmental or logistical constraints.

In conclusion, the ELLENEX - Plm2 L sensor provides a reliable solution for long-range liquid level monitoring, making it an excellent choice for a variety of industrial and environmental applications. Its robust design and efficient power use make it suitable for long-term deployments where regular maintenance is not feasible. However, users must consider the limitations related to environmental and installation variables to ensure optimal performance.
