## Technical Overview: ELLENEX - Plv2 L

### Working Principles

The ELLENEX - Plv2 L is an industrial-grade pressure and level sensor designed for various applications requiring accurate liquid level measurement. This sensor employs a piezoresistive sensing element to measure the pressure exerted by the liquid. The piezoresistive elements are packaged within a robust housing, suitable for harsh environmental conditions. When submerged, the sensor measures hydrostatic pressure, which directly correlates with the liquid level, and transmits the data via LoRaWAN protocol.

### Installation Guide

#### Pre-Installation Checks
1. **Site Survey**: Evaluate the deployment environment for obstructions and signal quality for LoRaWAN connectivity.
2. **Sensor Verification**: Ensure the sensor is calibrated and verify no visible signs of damage.

#### Installation Steps
1. **Mounting the Sensor**: Securely mount the sensor at the desired measurement depth. Use appropriate fixtures to protect the cable from kinks and breaks.
2. **Wiring Configuration**: Route the sensor cable carefully to ensure it remains free from damage. If applicable, connect the sensor leads to a data acquisition system.
3. **LoRaWAN Configuration**: Configure the device's network parameters, such as the Device EUI, App EUI, and App Key, using the associated software.
4. **Network Joining**: Ensure the sensor joins the LoRaWAN network by successfully completing the Over-the-Air Activation (OTAA) or Activation by Personalization (ABP) processes.

#### Post-Installation
- Verify the data transmission and communication with the LoRaWAN gateway.
- Check the accuracy of the readings by comparing them with manual measurements.

### LoRaWAN Details

- **Frequency Bands**: Configurable for various regions, including EU868, US915, AU915, and others as per regional regulations.
- **Data Rate**: Supports multiple LoRa data rates, which are adaptive for optimizing communication distance and power consumption.
- **Security**: Implements AES-128 encryption to secure the data transmission between the sensor and gateway.
- **Coverage**: Typically, LoRaWAN provides long-range connectivity up to 15-20 kilometers in rural areas and 2-5 kilometers in urban settings, depending on environmental factors.

### Power Consumption

- **Primary Power Source**: The ELLENEX - Plv2 L is typically powered by a long-life lithium battery, optimized for extended operation.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Thanks to energy-efficient electronics and adaptive data rates, the sensor can sustain battery life from several years depending on the reporting interval and environmental conditions.

### Use Cases

1. **Water Level Monitoring**: Ideal for surface and groundwater monitoring in reservoirs, rivers, and lakes.
2. **Tank Monitoring**: Useful for monitoring storage tank levels in industrial and agricultural applications.
3. **Flood Detection**: Effective for early warning systems in flood-prone areas.
4. **Irrigation Management**: Useful in agriculture for maintaining optimal water use efficiency.

### Limitations

- **Environmental Sensitivity**: Although robust, extreme environmental conditions such as high acidity, salinity, or extremely high temperatures may affect long-term sensor accuracy and life.
- **Signal Interference**: Dense infrastructure or heavily urbanized areas can attenuate LoRaWAN signals, affecting communication reliability.
- **Calibration Drift**: Regular maintenance and calibration may be required to maintain accuracy over time.
- **Installation Depth**: The sensor has a maximum depth rating; exceeding this may compromise its integrity and accuracy.

Overall, the ELLENEX - Plv2 L provides a robust solution for remote level monitoring applications, leveraging low-power, long-range LoRaWAN technology to deliver reliable and secure data transmission in various operational settings.
