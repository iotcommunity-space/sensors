**EVERYNET - Custom Everynet (EVERYNET)**

**Technical Overview**

**1. Working Principle:**
Everynet's core working principle revolves around the combination of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) technologies. Data is collected from various peripheral devices, which is then sent via the LPWAN network to a centralized system for storage and analysis. It utilizes the LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) communications protocol to facilitate the transmission of data over a vast area with minimal power consumption.

**2. Installation Guide:**
The installation process varies based on the specific Everynet devices in use. In general, the process starts with sourcing power and setting up network connectivity at the desired installation site. The devices are then physically installed and securely attached. Afterwards, the devices are programmed and set up on the Everynet network using the provided software suite. Finally, each device needs to be tested to ensure that it is working properly and effectively transmitting data.

**3. LoRaWAN details:**
Everynet devices primarily use LoRaWAN, a long-range, low-power wireless protocol thatâ€™s used for building IoT networks. This protocol provides features that support low-cost, mobile, secure bi-directional communication in IoT, M2M, and smart city and industrial applications. It operates within the license-free spectrum, meaning operators do not need to acquire expensive licenses to use the network and the power regulations allow a maximum of 0.2% duty cycle.

**4. Power Consumption:**
Everynet devices are designed for excellent energy efficiency. Through their use of the LoRaWAN protocol, they are capable of extremely low power consumption while maintaining a broad transmission range. This allows for battery-operated IoT devices that can function for years without requiring a replacement or recharge.

**5. Use Cases:**
Everynet has broad applicability across various sectors. These range from agriculture (tracking soil moisture or animal movements), to industry (monitoring machinery or environmental conditions), to logistics (tracking vehicles or packages), to urban environments (monitoring air quality or public utilities). Its broad reach and cost-effectivity make it a popular choice for organizations looking to digitize their operations.

**6. Limitations:**
While Everynet offers numerous advantages, there are a few limitations to consider. First, its long range is achieved at the expense of data transmission rates, which are low compared to broadband internet. Second, while the LoRaWAN protocol offers excellent coverage, physical obstructions can still potentially degrade signal quality. Third, while the system is generally secure, it is not entirely immune to cyber attacks, requiring consistent updates and maintenance for securing the network. Furthermore, the 0.2% duty cycle can also limit the number of messages that can be sent in a specific timeframe.
