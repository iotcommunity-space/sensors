## Technical Overview for WATTECO Ventilo Sensor

### Introduction
The WATTECO Ventilo Sensor is a cutting-edge IoT device designed to monitor and report environmental conditions, specifically focusing on applications related to HVAC systems. Its primary function is to measure air flow and temperature data, transmitting this information via LoRaWAN technology. It is an essential tool for optimizing energy consumption and maintaining comfortable indoor climates in residential, commercial, and industrial environments.

### Working Principles
The Ventilo Sensor operates on the principles of thermal anemometry to measure the velocity of air flow. It utilizes a heated element, detecting changes in resistance caused by air flow passing over the element, which allows it to calculate the velocity of the flow. Additionally, it incorporates a temperature sensor to monitor ambient air temperature.

The collected data is processed by an integrated microcontroller and wirelessly communicated to a central system via LoRaWAN connectivity. This enables low-power, long-range communication capabilities, making it suitable for both urban and rural installations.

### Installation Guide
1. **Location and Positioning**:
   - Identify the optimal location within the HVAC duct system where the sensor can accurately measure the desired air flow and temperature parameters.
   - Ensure the area is accessible for maintenance and within LoRaWAN network range.

2. **Mounting**:
   - Securely mount the sensor using the provided brackets and fixings. The orientation should align with the airflow direction to ensure accurate readings.

3. **Power Up and Configuration**:
   - Install the supplied batteries or connect to a suitable power source if using an external power option.
   - Use the accompanying user interface or configuration tool to set the desired network settings and operational parameters.

4. **Integration**:
   - Pair the sensor with the LoRaWAN gateway, ensuring that network join processes such as OTAA (Over The Air Activation) are properly executed.
   - Verify signal strength and data transmission accuracy through initial testing phases.

### LoRaWAN Details
