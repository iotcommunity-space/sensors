### Technical Overview: ELLENEX - Plc2 L

The ELLENEX Plc2 L is a sophisticated, compact LoRaWAN-enabled pressure and level sensor designed for remote monitoring applications. This sensor is designed to cater to industries requiring precise fluid level and pressure measurements, such as water management, agriculture, and oil and gas.

#### Working Principles

The Plc2 L utilizes a piezo-resistive sensing element to measure pressure and infer fluid levels. It consists of a high-accuracy pressure transducer that converts the physical pressure exerted by the fluid column above the device into an electrical signal. These signals are then processed and transmitted over a LoRaWAN network to a central management platform, allowing for real-time monitoring and data analysis.

#### Installation Guide

1. **Site Survey & Preparation**: Ensure that the installation site is within the coverage range of a LoRaWAN gateway. Clear any obstacles that might interfere with wireless signals.

2. **Mounting the Device**: 
   - **Sensor Placement**: Submerge the sensor in the fluid at the desired measurement point. The sensor cable should be secured to avoid movement caused by currents.
   - **Cable Routing**: Route the cable safely back to an accessible junction box or secured mounting point, ensuring that it is protected from physical damage and environmental exposure.

3. **Electrical Connections**:
   - Connect the sensor cable to the power supply and data logger if used outside standalone operation.

4. **Configuration**: 
   - Use the manufacturer's software to configure sensor parameters, such as measurement range, data transmission intervals, and network credentials.
   - Verify LoRaWAN network configuration and register the device on the network server.

5. **Calibration**: Calibrate the sensor using known reference pressure or level points to ensure measurement accuracy.

6. **Testing**: 
   - Perform initial testing to ensure the device is operational and transmitting data as expected.
   - Check for any data anomalies and reposition or recalibrate the device as necessary.

#### LoRaWAN Details

- **Frequency Bands**: Supports multiple frequency bands as per regional regulations (e.g., EU868, US915).
- **Data Transmission**: Utilizes LoRaWAN Class A for energy-efficient communication with adaptive data rate features to optimize performance.
- **Network Server Integration**: Compatible with standard LoRaWAN network servers such as The Things Network (TTN) for device management and data routing.

#### Power Consumption

The Plc2 L is designed for low-power operation to maximize battery life over extended deployment periods. The typical power consumption is as follows:

- **Sleep Mode**: < 5 µA
- **Measurement Mode**: ~2 mA (varies with sensing duration)
- **Transmission Mode**: ~40 mA at peak

The device is powered by a long-lasting lithium battery capable of sustaining operations for up to 5 years, subject to configuration settings and environmental conditions.

#### Use Cases

- **Water Level Monitoring**: Deployed in reservoirs, rivers, and underground water storage to manage water resources effectively.
- **Agricultural Irrigation**: Used to automate irrigation systems by providing real-time data on soil moisture levels and water usage.
- **Oil & Gas**: Monitors pressure levels in storage tanks to prevent overfilling and optimize logistics.
- **Industrial Processes**: Provides data in processing plants to ensure efficient management of chemical and liquid storage.

#### Limitations

- **Environmental Constraints**: While the sensor is robust, it must be protected against aggressive chemical environments or extreme temperatures beyond its operating range (-20°C to 60°C).
- **Signal Interference**: Dense foliage, buildings, or metallic structures may affect LoRaWAN signal transmission. Strategic gateway placement is essential for optimal performance.
- **Measurement Range**: Limited to the specified pressure range of the sensor. Exceeding this may result in inaccurate readings or sensor damage.
- **Battery Life**: Although designed for long life, frequent data transmission or harsh environmental conditions can reduce battery longevity.

The ELLENEX Plc2 L stands out for its accuracy, ease of use, and reliable data transmission capabilities, making it an essential tool for modern fluid management applications.
