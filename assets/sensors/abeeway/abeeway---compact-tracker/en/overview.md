## ABEEWAY - Compact Tracker Technical Overview

### 1. Working Principles
The ABEEWAY compact tracker operates on the principle of combining geolocation technologies. The compact tracker is equipped with GPS, low-power GPS, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi SRD and operates on LoRaWAN communication technology. It uses behavioral analysis software algorithms and advanced power management capabilities to deliver high-precision localization, reducing its power consumption. 

Unlike traditional GPS technology, this cutting-edge ABEEWAY device dramatically reduces the power needs by intelligently switching between different location technologies based on signal availability, context, and device motion.

### 2. Installation Guide
The ABEEWAY compact tracker is a low-maintenance device due to its simplicity in design and ease of use. It requires no specific installation procedure. For its initial setup, ensure that the device is fully charged and switch it on. The tracker comes with an operational configuration by default, but you can manage the configuration via the API to best suit your needs.

### 3. LoRaWAN Details
ABEEWAY utilizes LoRaWAN (Low-Power, Wide-Area Networks) technology which promises long-range connectivity of IoT devices and high battery life. With LoRaWAN, the tracker can communicate over several kilometers (indoor or outdoor) with a battery life that can last up to several years.

The tracker uses this connection to send its location data and to receive updates or commands from the central system (gateway). It operates in the ISM band, and LoRaWAN protocol ensures secure bidirectional communication, mobility, and localization services.

### 4. Power Consumption 
One significant advantage of ABEEWAY compact tracker is its low power consumption. It has been optimized for a long battery life, typically lasting up to several years depending on the frequency of updates. The power conservation is achieved by leveraging efficient power management software and by switching between different positioning technologies based on the device's context and movements.

### 5. Use Cases
ABEEWAY compact tracker is highly versatile and can be used in several scenarios:

- **Asset Tracking**: To keep track of valuable assets and equipment.
- **Logistics & Supply Chain Monitoring**: To track the location of goods in transit.
- **Livestock Tracking**: To monitor the location and health of livestock.
- **Fleet Tracking**: To monitor and manage fleet vehicles.
- **Environmental Monitoring**: To supervise conditions in different environments.

### 6. Limitations
Consequently, despite its wide-ranging advantages, there are some limitations related to the ABEEWAY compact tracker:

- The accuracy of location tracking may be affected in dense urban areas where GPS signals can be compromised.
- The tracker relies on LoRaWAN network coverage, limiting its use in locations where no coverage is available.
- Its rugged design does not make it suitable for indoor tracking like in-store product relocation.
- Due to its low-power consumption design, high-frequency location updates can drain the battery more quickly.
