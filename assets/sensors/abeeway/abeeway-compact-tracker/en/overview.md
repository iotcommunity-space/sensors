## Technical Overview of ABEEWAY - Compact Tracker

### Introduction

The ABEEWAY Compact Tracker is an IoT-enabled device designed to offer precise location tracking in a compact and portable form factor. It utilizes multiple geolocation technologies and operates over LoRaWAN networks, making it an ideal solution for a variety of asset tracking applications, including personal safety, fleet management, and resource allocation.

### Working Principles

The Compact Tracker employs a combination of GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and GPS-free location technologies like LoRa TDoA (Time Difference of Arrival) to deliver accurate geolocation services. This hybrid approach provides flexibility and accuracy, allowing tracking even in challenging environments where GPS signals may be weak or unavailable, such as indoors or in urban canyons.

1. **GPS**: Primarily used for outdoor positioning, providing high accuracy.
2. **Wi-Fi**: Enables indoor positioning by triangulating the location based on nearby Wi-Fi networks.
3. **BLE**: Suitable for proximity-based applications and indoor tracking.
4. **LoRa TDoA**: Allows for GPS-free positioning by leveraging the network's radio towers’ time-difference to determine location.

### Installation Guide

#### Steps for Installation:

1. **Unboxing and Activation**:
   - Remove the tracker from its packaging.
   - Power on the device by pressing the activation button until the LED indicator blinks.
   
2. **Configuration**:
   - Download the Abeeway Device Manager application.
   - Connect via Bluetooth for initial setup.
   - Configure the device settings, including transmission interval, modes (static, motion, outdoor, and indoor tracking), and alert thresholds.

3. **Mounting**:
   - Depending on the usage scenario, secure the tracker to the desired asset using suitable mounting solutions (e.g., adhesive, screws, or lanyards).

4. **Network Registration**:
   - Ensure the device is registered on a compatible LoRaWAN network by contacting your network provider.
   - Use the device’s unique DevEUI, AppEUI, and AppKey for integration and activation on the LoRaWAN network server.

### LoRaWAN Details

The Compact Tracker utilizes the LoRaWAN network for data transmission, catering to low-power, wide-area network (LPWAN) requirements. This facilitates energy-efficient communication over long distances, supporting the following:

1. **Frequency Bands**: Available in multiple frequencies such as EU868, US915, AS923, catering to global applications.
2. **Class A Device**: Operates in bi-directional end-devices with downlink communication after each uplink transmission, optimizing battery life.
3. **Security**: Features robust encryptions with AES-128 to protect data integrity across communication channels.

### Power Consumption

The Compact Tracker is designed with energy efficiency in mind, featuring an integrated rechargeable battery. It supports extended battery life, providing several months of operation per charge, which varies based on tracking mode, frequency of updates, and environmental factors.

- **Stand-by Mode**: Low power consumption, preserving battery life.
- **Active Tracking Mode**: Increased power use for real-time updates and frequent location checks.
- **Battery Life**: Typically ranges from several weeks to months, depending on configuration and usage.

### Use Cases

1. **Asset Tracking**: Ideal for logistics companies needing to monitor high-value goods or equipment.
2. **Personal Safety**: Useful for individuals who require tracking for safety purposes, such as lone workers or outdoor enthusiasts.
3. **Fleet Management**: Efficient in tracking vehicles for optimized route management and enhanced operational efficiency.
4. **Resource Allocation**: Assists in tracking and management of physical assets in large facilities like warehouses or hospitals.

### Limitations

- **Coverage Limitations**: LoRaWAN coverage is necessary; may have limited availability in remote or underdeveloped areas.
- **Signal Interference**: Environments with dense materials or large structures might impact GPS and network signals.
- **Battery Dependency**: Regular charging is required, especially in high-frequency tracking modes.
- **Indoor Precision**: While it uses Wi-Fi and BLE for indoor positioning, accuracy is dependent on environmental factors such as network availability and interference.

The ABEEWAY Compact Tracker is a versatile and reliable tool for various tracking needs, leveraging a blend of advanced technologies while being mindful of energy consumption and operational efficiency.
