### ABEEWAY - Micro Tracker

#### Overview
The ABEEWAY Micro Tracker is a highly versatile, advanced Internet of Things (IoT) device that utilizes LoRaWAN technology to provide efficient, reliable, and long-ranged tracking services. Combining advanced motion-sensing and location-determining technologies, it enables users to accurately track various types of movable assets such as people, vehicles, or other mobile objects.

#### Working Principle
The Micro Tracker operates by transmitting data over the LoRaWAN network, a Low-Power wide-area network (LPWAN) designed to allow low bit rate communication over long-distance, maximizing both battery and signal range. The device, equipped with motion sensors, GPS, and BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) capabilities, detects movement and location information and transmits this data back over the LoRaWAN network to be accessed in real-time by the end-user.

#### Installation Guide
The installation of the Micro Tracker is simple and straightforward. The step-by-step process is as follows:

1. Switch on the device by pressing the power button and wait for the LED to blink, indicating power on status.
2. Pair the device with the ABEEWAY application available on smart devices via BLE.
3. Configure the device settings according to your specific tracking needs. This includes setting movement thresholds, adjusting GPS parameters, and managing other alert conditions.
4. Place or attach the device onto the asset you wish to track. The method depends on the nature of the asset with different approaches for people (e.g., clipped onto clothing), vehicles (e.g., placed within the car), and other items.

#### LoRaWAN Details
The ABEEWAY Micro Tracker operates on the standardized LoRaWAN protocol which provides significant advantages for IoT applications needing secure, bi-directional, geolocation-capable data transmission. It employs adaptive data rate (ADR) control to automatically optimize power consumption and data transmission based on network conditions.

#### Power Consumption
The Micro Tracker achieves impressive battery life due to its low-power operation. Decoding of data is done 'on-chip', which dramatically reduces operating power. The device also employs smart-power management protocols, only activating GPS and other high consumption features when necessary. The battery can last up to several months or even years, depending on the activity and use case.

#### Use Cases
ABEEWAY Micro Tracker can be employed in numerous scenarios due to its versatile nature. Some prime use-cases are:

- Asset tracking: It helps companies to keep track of their movable assets, preventing theft or loss, and ensuring optimal utilization of resources.
- Fleet management: It aids in managing and coordinating fleets efficiently, providing real-time data on each vehicle's location and movement.
- Personal safety: It can be used as a safety device for people, especially elders or children, providing real-time location updates in case of emergencies.

#### Limitations
While the Micro Tracker offers numerous advantages, a few limitations should be considered:

1. Signal Strength: The operational range and accuracy depend on the LoRaWAN network coverage. If the device operates in an area with weak network coverage, the tracking accuracy may be compromised.
2. Battery Life: Battery life may significantly diminish if GPS or BLE remain active continuously or in areas with high activity levels and poorer than optimal network conditions.

Nevertheless, despite these limitations, the ABEEWAY Micro Tracker remains a powerful tool for a variety of demands in the realm of IoT tracking.
