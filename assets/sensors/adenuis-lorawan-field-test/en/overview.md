### Technical Overview of ADENUIS - LoRaWAN Field Test Device

#### Introduction
The ADENUIS - LoRaWAN Field Test device is a comprehensive tool designed for assessing and monitoring LoRaWAN network performance in various field applications. It aids in signal strength evaluation, network coverage testing, and provides diagnostic capabilities for LoRaWAN networks to ensure optimal performance and deployment efficiency.

#### Working Principles
ADENUIS operates by transmitting and receiving LoRaWAN signals to analyze various parameters such as Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), and data rate efficiency. By scanning different channels and frequencies, the device evaluates the network’s robustness and reliability, allowing for real-time adjustments in network configurations.

The device incorporates sensor data logging, which aids in understanding environmental impacts on network performance. This is crucial for deployments in challenging terrains or urban environments with potential interference. Through an intuitive interface, the test results can be visualized and documented for further analysis.
