# Technical Overview for DECENTLAB DL-PHEHT

## 1. Introduction

The DECENTLAB DL-PHEHT is a sophisticated environmental monitoring device designed to measure pH, electrical conductivity, and temperature using a single, integrated unit. Equipped with high-precision sensors and LoRaWAN connectivity, it is suitable for a wide range of applications such as agriculture, water quality monitoring, and environmental research. This document provides a comprehensive technical overview, including its working principles, installation guidelines, LoRaWAN details, power consumption, use cases, and potential limitations.

## 2. Working Principles

### 2.1 pH Measurement
- **Sensor Type**: The DL-PHEHT uses an industrial-grade pH sensor with an ion-selective electrode that measures the voltage potential difference between the pH-sensitive glass electrode and a reference electrode.
- **Calibration**: The device requires periodic calibration using standard pH buffer solutions to ensure accuracy.

### 2.2 Electrical Conductivity (EC) Measurement
- **Sensor Type**: The device uses a conductivity cell with platinum electrodes for measuring the electrolytic conductivity of the solution. The measured conductivity is an indicator of the total ion concentration in the liquid.
- **Temperature Compensation**: Built-in temperature compensation ensures accurate readings across different temperature ranges.

### 2.3 Temperature Measurement
- **Sensor Type**: A precision thermistor provides temperature readings crucial for compensation in pH and EC measurements.

## 3. Installation Guide

### 3.1 Site Selection
- Choose a site that allows consistent exposure to the sample being measured (e.g., river, water tank, or soil sample setup for EC).

### 3.2 Sensor Placement
- Ensure the sensor probes are fully submerged in the liquid sample for accurate data acquisition.
- Avoid placing the sensor near magnetic fields or power lines that could influence readings.

### 3.3 Installation Steps
1. **Mount the Device**: Securely mount the DL-PHEHT using brackets or enclosures that protect it from environmental factors like rain, wind, and temperature extremes.
2. **Connect the Sensor Probes**: Ensure all connections are waterproof and secure to prevent water ingress.
3. **Power Up the Device**: Insert batteries or connect to a stable power source as specified in the manual.
4. **Calibrate the Sensor**: Follow the manufacturer’s calibration procedure using the provided or recommended calibration liquids.

## 4. LoRaWAN Details

### 4.1 Frequency and Connectivity
- **Frequency Bands**: Supports the standard LoRaWAN frequency bands (EU868, US915, etc.).
- **Connectivity**: Connects to a LoRaWAN network gateway to transmit data securely over long distances.

### 4.2 Data Transmission
- **Data Rate**: Adjustable LoRa data rates (DR0 to DR5) as per distance and environmental conditions.
- **Payload Format**: Provides detailed payload formats to decode pH, EC, and temperature data in the application server.

### 4.3 Network Integration
- **Setup**: Requires standard LoRaWAN device activation protocols (OTAA or ABP) for network integration.
- **Configuration**: Use the Decentlab web interface or mobile app for configuration and monitoring.

## 5. Power Consumption

### 5.1 Battery Specification
