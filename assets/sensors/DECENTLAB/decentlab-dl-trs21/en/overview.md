## Technical Overview: DECENTLAB - DL-TRS21

### Introduction
The DECENTLAB DL-TRS21 is a sophisticated IoT sensor designed for real-time temperature measurement. It operates using LoRaWAN protocols, offering extended range and low power consumption, making it ideal for remote environmental monitoring applications.

### Working Principles
The DL-TRS21 employs a high-precision temperature sensor housed in a robust enclosure. It detects temperature changes via a resistive or semiconductor sensing element, converting the analog signal into a digital format for transmission. Its core function is to measure ambient temperature with high accuracy and transmit this data over LoRaWAN networks for remote monitoring and analysis.

### Installation Guide

1. **Site Selection:**
   - Choose a location within the desired monitoring area that is free from direct sunlight, moisture, or extreme environmental conditions that could lead to erroneous readings.

2. **Mounting:**
   - Secure the sensor using the provided bracket or mounting equipment. Ensure it is mounted vertically and is stable to withstand environmental conditions.

3. **Powering the Device:**
   - The sensor is powered by internal batteries. Ensure the batteries are inserted correctly before proceeding. Check battery level and replace if necessary.

4. **Activation:**
   - The device is typically pre-configured. To activate, switch the device on by removing the battery tab or using the switch as instructed in the manual.

5. **Connectivity:**
   - Ensure that a LoRaWAN gateway is within range for successful communication. Perform a test transmission to confirm that data is being sent and received correctly.

6. **Calibration:**
   - Though factory-calibrated, if field calibration is necessary, follow the specific calibration procedures outlined in the sensorâ€™s technical manual.

7. **Final Checks:**
   - Verify that the sensor is functioning correctly by checking the LED indicators and initial readings. Adjust settings as needed via the configuration interface.
