### Technical Overview of DECENTLAB - DL TBRG

#### Introduction
The DECENTLAB DL TBRG is a high-precision rain gauge designed for collecting and transmitting precipitation data using LoRaWAN technology. It is tailored for environmental monitoring applications where continuous and remote data logging is essential.

#### Working Principles

The DL TBRG utilizes a tipping bucket mechanism, where precipitation fills a small bucket which tips at a predetermined threshold weight, thereby triggering a reed switch. The count of these tips, each representing a known volume of water (typically 0.2 mm of rainwater), is logged and used to calculate rainfall intensity and total volume. The device then transmits this data via LoRaWAN to a central server or cloud-based application.

#### Installation Guide

1. **Site Selection**: Choose a location that is representative of the area to be monitored. Ensure there are no overhanging obstacles like trees or structures that could affect rain capture.

2. **Mounting**: Securely mount the rain gauge on a stable pole or structure. The top of the rain gauge should be installed level to ensure accurate tipping mechanism operation.

3. **Orientation**: The device should be free from obstructions to avoid wind effects. If possible, the gauge should be installed away from areas that might cause splash or accumulation of water other than direct rainfall.

4. **Calibration**: Ensure the tipping mechanism is calibrated correctly for accurate measurement. DECENTLAB devices typically come pre-calibrated, but installation environments can require adjustments.

5. **Power Setup**: Install the battery pack according to the manual. The device is powered by long-lasting batteries; ensure connections are secure.

6. **Initial Configuration**: Connect the device to the LoRaWAN network following the provided configuration guide, ensuring correct device pairing and activation.

#### LoRaWAN Details

- **Frequency Bands**: The DL TBRG supports multiple frequency bands (EU868, US915, AS923, etc.) and needs to be configured to comply with local regulations.
- **Data Rate**: Operates on adaptive data rate (ADR), optimizing data transmission factors based on signal quality and network congestion.
- **Payload**: The data payload includes timestamps, the number of recorded tips, derived rainfall volume, and other status information.
- **Join Procedure**: Uses Over-the-Air Activation (OTAA) for dynamic address allocation and security.

#### Power Consumption

The DL TBRG is engineered to be energy efficient, leveraging low-power components and sleep modes. Typical power consumption is minimal during idle periods and increases slightly during active transmission. The device is usually powered by a lithium battery pack, capable of sustaining operation for several years depending on the transmission frequency and environmental conditions.

#### Use Cases

- **Agricultural Monitoring**: Assists farmers in managing water resources effectively by providing precise rainfall data.
- **Flood Risk Management**: Helps in predicting floods by supplying real-time rainfall data critical for water level analysis.
- **Weather Stations**: Complements other meteorological instruments in collecting localized climate data.
- **Urban Drainage Systems**: Supports efficient management of stormwater systems by offering accurate precipitation measurements.

#### Limitations

- **Line of Sight**: LoRaWAN communication requires a good line of sight to the nearest gateway for optimal data transmission, which can be challenging in dense urban environments.
- **Obstructions**: Nearby trees, buildings, or other physical barriers can affect both the data accuracy and the transmission efficiency.
- **Environmental Conditions**: Extreme environmental conditions, such as strong winds or incorrect placement by the user, can lead to misreading by causing premature tipping.
- **Maintenance**: Requires periodic calibration checks and cleaning to prevent debris buildup on the tipping mechanism, which can affect accuracy.

This high-performance rain gauge by DECENTLAB offers a robust solution for remote sensing in diverse environmental settings, making it suitable for real-time data-driven decision-making across various domains.
