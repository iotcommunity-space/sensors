### Working Principles

#### Sensor Technology
- **DS18B20 Sensor**: The DL-DLDS18 incorporates the DS18B20, a digital thermometer presenting temperature in a 9 to 12-bit resolution, configurable within the operating temperature range of -55°C to +125°C.
- **Digital Communication**: The sensor uses a 1-Wire communication protocol, allowing easy interfacing and precise data acquisition without the need for multiple input/output pins.

#### LoRaWAN Communication
- **Protocol Compliance**: The device supports LoRaWAN protocol, a Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) specification intended for wireless battery-operated IoT devices in a regional, national, or global network.
- **Frequency Bands**: The DL-DLDS18 operates on various ISM bands, including EU868, US915, AU915, and others, ensuring global operability.
- **Adaptive Data Rate (ADR)**: This feature optimizes data rates, airtime, and energy consumption required for communication.

### Installation Guide

1. **Placement**: Select an optimal location for sensor deployment. Ensure the site aligns with your monitoring requirements (e.g., shaded, exposed, specific test location).
2. **Mounting**: Use the provided mounting accessories to secure the sensor. The device can be mounted on a pole or a wall using adjustable brackets.
3. **Antenna Installation**: Attach the LoRa antenna to the connector provided. Ensure it is tightly secured to maintain signal integrity.
4. **Power Activation**: Insert the batteries as per the orientation marked in the compartment. Close the compartment to ensure weatherproof sealing.
5. **Network Joining**: Power on the device and follow the steps listed in the user manual to join the network via Over-The-Air Activation (OTAA) or Activation By Personalization (ABP).
6. **Configuration**: Using DECENTLAB’s web interface or the mobile application, configure parameters such as payload interval, sensor calibration, and data threshold alerts.
