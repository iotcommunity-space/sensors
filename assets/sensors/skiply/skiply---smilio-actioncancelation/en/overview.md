**Technical Overview - SKIPLY - Smilio Action Cancellation**

**1. Working Principles**

The SKIPLY - Smilio Action Cancellation (SKIPLY) is an advanced IoT-based system specifically designed for monitoring, controlling, and reducing the frequency of arbitrary actions, and generating comprehensive reports on the same. 

At its core, the system functions via a network of smart sensors, a dedicated LoRaWAN communication protocol and a centralized cloud-based server. The installed sensors detect a certain action when it happens, such as usage of equipment. This information is sent through the LoRaWAN network to the central server, where it is processed and stored. In situations when a particular action needs to be cancelled, the server sends a remote command to the system or directly to the equipment (if possible), thereby canceling the action.

**2. Installation Guide**

Installation of SKIPLY system requires professional expertise due to its intricate setup. The installation process starts with the sensor placement on the devices that need to be monitored. Following this, the LoRaWAN gateway should be installed and set up for optimal signal coverage. Once done, connect each sensor to the LoRaWAN gateway, making sure each device has been correctly identified and registered on the network.

After a successful setup, connect to the central server for analyzing and storing data. The server should have dedicated software to manage, analyze, and act upon the data received from the sensors. Test the system thoroughly before going live.

**3. LoRaWAN Details**

SKIPLY uses LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) to communicate between the sensors and the server. LoRaWAN is known for long-range, low-power communication which is ideal for IoT applications. The network can manage multiple devices efficiently due to its advanced load balancing. This IoT-based network is also highly secured with end-to-end AES128 encryption offering reliable, safe data transmission.

**4. Power Consumption**

The power consumption varies with the kind of sensors used, frequency of data transmission, and network load. But overall, since SKIPLY utilizes low-power LoRaWAN technology, its power consumption is considerably low, making it suitable for prolonged use without requiring regular charging or battery replacements. 

**5. Use Cases**

SKIPLY - Smilio Action Cancellation system can be effectively used in various scenarios:
- It could be utilized in industrial environments where certain machine activities need to be curtailed based on varying conditions.
- It can be applied in logistics to remotely control various items of interest.
- SKIPLY can also be used in commercial spaces like shopping centers to prevent access to certain areas or disable certain functionalities.

**6. Limitations**

Although the SKIPLY is a powerful system, it has some limitations:
- The efficiency of the system depends on the LoRaWAN signal strength; obstacles or large distances may disrupt the signal, causing interruptions.
- The system requires professional installation and maintenance; troubleshooting can be complex if not done by trained personnel.
- The capacity of the system is dependent on the server's ability to process the incoming data streams.
- Upfront costs might be high especially when deploying the system on a large scale. 

Despite these limitations, SKIPLY offers benefits like automation, remote control, and monitoring, making it a valuable addition to various industries. The device operates effectively while limiting any unnecessary actions and ensuring smooth operations. This IoT-based system is poised to set a benchmark in an increasingly connected world.
