Technical Overview for At Series - At101 

1. Working Principles:

   The At Series - At101 (At Series) is an Internet of Things (IoT) sensor device designed for wireless data collection and transmission. It collects data through its in-built sensors and processes it using the onboard microcontroller. The microcontroller is programmed to analyze and interpret sensor data and convert it into meaningful information. The interpreted information is then sent to the user or the server using the LoRaWAN technology.

2. Installation Guide:

   i. Unbox the sensor device and ensure all the components are safely intact.
  ii. The sensor should be station-mounted on a wall, pole, or any secure location where data is to be collected.
 iii. Ensure the device is within range of the LoRaWAN gateway for effective data transmission.
  iv. Power up the sensor (either using the inbuilt battery or external source) and turn on the device. 
   v. Follow the prompt on the device for further setup, including configuring it to connect to your specific LoRaWAN network. You may need to input network specifics manually.

3. LoRaWAN Details:

   The At1-1 sensor operates on the LoRaWAN protocol, a Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) specification designed for wireless battery-operated devices. This technology is ideal for IoT devices and allows for the transmission of data over long distances with minimal power consumption.

4. Power Consumption:

   The At101 is designed to optimize power utilization. Given its wireless nature, the majority of power is used for data transmission via LoRaWAN technology. Under normal operation, power consumption is kept to a minimum, allowing for longer operating intervals, especially useful when the device is reliant on battery power.

5. Use Cases:

The At Series - At101 sensor is versatile and can be utilized in a wide array of scenarios:

   i. Agriculture: The sensor can monitor weather conditions or soil fertility.
  ii. Environmental Monitoring: The device is useful for monitoring pollution levels, noise levels, and other environmental parameters.
 iii. Smart Cities: The device can be used to monitor traffic conditions, parking availability, and city-wide environmental factors.

6. Limitations:

   i. Limited Range: Although LoRaWAN allows for long-distance transmissions, sensor data transmission is still subject to physical and environmental obstacles such as buildings or overpowering signals.
  ii. Battery Life: The lifetime of the device is dependent on data transmission frequencies. High-frequency transmissions may deplete the battery faster as most of the power goes to data transmission.
 iii. The sensorâ€™s performance may vary based upon its communication environment, as well as how congested the network frequencies are in its vicinity. 

Remember that these are various key points on how to use the At Series - At101 effectively for your specific use case. By understanding the device's scope and limitations, you can maximize its capabilities and ensure a long-lasting and effective service life.
