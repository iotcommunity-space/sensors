Title: Technical Overview of LANSITEC - Nb IoT Macro Bluetooth Gateway

I. Working Principles
The LANSITEC - Nb IoT Macro Bluetooth Gateway operates by gathering data from a multitude of Bluetooth devices in its vicinity, via the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology. The collected data is then forwarded through the Nb-IoT network to a cloud service or a local server. Efficiency is achieved via Nb-IoT, a subset of the 5g standard optimized for low power consumption and deep penetration.

II. Installation Guide
Install the LANSITEC gateway using the provided mounts. After the physical installation, activate the device and connect it to the Nb-IoT network. Online activation using a QR code is supported. Use the default settings or customize the gateway to suit your needs. Make sure to adhere to all guidance for site selection and remember to take the steps to secure the device from physical tampering.

III. LoRaWAN Details
The LANSITEC Gateway is LoRaWAN compliant; it supports LPWAN INTERNET OF THINGS (IoT) connectivity across long ranges, providing a secure, efficient conduit for data transmission through the cloud to your server.

IV. Power Consumption
The macro gateway's power consumption is minimal because of its Nb-IoT functionality. The device can run on a single pair of AA batteries for up to a year, depending on the frequency of data transmission and other factors. 

V. Use Cases 
The LANSITEC Gateway is ideal for smart city deployments, intelligent agriculture, supply chain management, and asset tracking. With the capacity to gather data from a multitude of Bluetooth devices, it provides an essential hub for IoT ecosystems.

VI. Limitations
