## LANSITEC - Compact Bluetooth Gateway: Technical Overview

### Working Principles

The LANSITEC Compact Bluetooth Gateway is a key component in IoT applications for data collection from Bluetooth sensors. Leveraging advanced Low Power Bluetooth LE technology, it collects data signals from Bluetooth-enabled devices within its range, and then sends them to a LoRaWAN server, which processes the data and makes it available for use.

The gateway operates by continuously scanning its environment for active Bluetooth devices. After establishing connection with them via built-in algorithms, it retrieves the beacon data from these devices and transmits this information over LoRaWAN. The primary purpose is the exchange of data between physically close IoT nodes and a remote central server.

### Installation Guide

1. **Location Selection:** Secure an optimal high location, preferably on a wall. The installation height should be about 2-3m from the ground. 
   
2. **Connecting the Power Supply:** Connect the provided micro-USB cable to the Gateway. Make sure to use the original power supply included in the box for safe operation. 

3. **Network Configuration:** Use the LoRaWAN network parameters set by your network provider to configure the Compact Bluetooth Gateway. Via the LANSITEC administrator console, you can set the network parameters.

4. **Device Configuration:** Pair the target Bluetooth devices with the Gateway using the LANSITEC administrator console.

### LoRaWAN Details

The LANSITEC Gateway leverages LoRaWAN technology, which is a protocol specifically designed for wireless battery-operated devices in a regional, national or global network. Offering superb energy efficiency, robust signal strength, and long range, it sends packets of data across long distances. This Gateway supports LoRaWAN protocol versions 1.0.2 and 1.0.3.

### Power Consumption

LANSITEC Compact Bluetooth Gateway is designed for low power consumption. It operates with an average power consumption of <1.25W in full running mode. This low energy requirement allows the gateway to function for extended periods without a high energy cost.

### Use Cases

1. **Asset Tracking:** Provides location tracking services for valuable assets within a defined space, such as a warehouse, factory, or hospital.
   
2. **Indoor Navigation:** Assists in accurately guiding individuals through complex indoor spaces like shopping malls or airports.

3. **Demand-Responsive Transport:** Aids in real-time fleet management and optimizes route planning for transport vehicles.

### Limitations

1. **Range:** The range of the Bluetooth Gateway depends heavily on its environment. Physical obstacles can degrade the efficiency of the signal reception and transmission.

2. **Data Transfer Rate:** Given Bluetooth and LoRa technology are designed for low power use and long-range transmission, high speed, and high volume data transfer isn't possible.

3. **Compatibility:** The Gateway can only connect with Bluetooth-enabled devices and may not respond to devices running older versions of Bluetooth.
   
Remember that the LANSITEC Compact Bluetooth Gateway is a powerful tool when integrated with compliant sensors and systems, despite these limitations. Its compact size, low power requirement, and extensive coverage make it an excellent data transmission solution for many IoT applications.
