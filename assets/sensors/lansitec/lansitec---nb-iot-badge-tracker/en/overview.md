**Technical Overview: LANSITEC â€“ Nb IoT Badge Tracker**

**I. Working Principles**

The LANSITEC Nb IoT Badge Tracker operates based on Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT), a Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) radio technology standard developed to enable a wide range of devices and services. This device uses the cellular communication technology that is designed for the Internet of Things (IoT). The tracker sends signals to the NB-IoT network, which are then made accessible over the cloud for tracking and analysis. The tracker includes an integrated accelerometer for motion detection, enhancing its ability to monitor and manage assets and personnel efficiently.

**II. Installation Guide**

1. Charge the device fully before initial use.
2. Mount the device at the desired location. Ensure that the area has good NB-IoT network coverage.
3. Configure the device by connecting it to a computer or mobile device. Use the provided software to set up parameters like reporting frequency, motion sensitivity, and power management.
4. Connect the device to the cloud using the assigned credentials.
5. Run a test to verify that the device reports data accurately and consistently.

**III. LoRaWAN Details**

While this device primarily operates on the NB-IoT network, it's also compatible with LoRaWAN networks, another type of low-power wide area network protocol. Leveraging this dual-network compatibility allows the user to switch between or combine the NB-IoT and LoRaWAN connection based on their specific use scenario, thus improving signal coverage and transmission efficiency.

**IV. Power Consumption**

The LANSITEC Nb IoT Badge Tracker is designed for low-power consumption, making it ideal for long-term tracking projects. With a battery capacity of 400mAh, it can run up to 5 years (on the condition of 2 uplink messages per day) before the battery needs replacement, depending on the reporting frequency and the network signal strength.

**V. Use Cases**

This device can be used in a variety of scenarios, including but not limited to:

1. Asset tracking: With real-time location updates, use it to monitor the movement and utilization of valuable assets.
2. Personnel tracking: Attach a badge tracker to a worker's ID badge to visually manage and ensure the safety of personnel.
3. Logistic and supply chain monitoring: Track the movement of goods on the road, sea, or by air.

**VI. Limitations**

While the LANSITEC Nb IoT Badge Tracker offers many benefits, it may also have some limitations such as:

1. Dependence on NB-IoT Network: The device's performance is heavily reliant on the strength and coverage of the NB-IoT network.
2. No Inbuilt GPS: The tracker doesn't have an inbuilt GPS, which means it might not provide precise location details indoors or in places with weak signal strength.
3. Limited Battery Life: Although it promises long battery life, this is at a very low reporting frequency, so more frequent use may drain the battery faster.
4. Non-IP-Rated: The tracker is not specified to any specific IP (Ingress Protection) rating, so the exposure to water and dust may affect the device performance and durability.
5. No Onboard Data Storage: There is no onboard storage for data caching in areas of no network coverage.
