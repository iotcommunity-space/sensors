**LANSITEC - Helmet Sensor Technical Overview**

**1. Working Principles:** 

The LANSITEC helmet sensor, a crucial IoT device, primarily functions based on technologies such as motion detection and GPS location tracking. It uses an accelerometer to detect any significant movement (indicative of helmet usage) or any sudden significant vertical movement (indicative of a fall or impact). Upon detecting any such event, the sensor immediately activates its GPS module to determine and transmit its location.

**2. Installation Guide:** 

The LANSITEC helmet sensor comes as a discrete, portable unit that can be easily integrated into any helmet design. 

Step 1: Unbox the sensor. 

Step 2: Place the sensor in the predetermined position inside the helmet. 

Step 3: Connect to the LANSITEC server using the LoRaWAN radio interface for testing and configuration. For this, open the LANSITEC monitoring application on your PC, enter the device’s NB-IoT/LoRaWAN ID, and follow the on-screen instructions to complete setup. 

**3. LoRaWAN Details:**

LoRaWAN technology offers the LANSITEC helmet sensor a low-power, long-range communication medium to the central server. The sensor periodically sends information about its state and location via LoRaWAN communication, enabling real-time tracking and monitoring.

**4. Power Consumption:**

The LANSITEC helmet sensor is designed with low power consumption in mind. An advantage of LoRaWAN technology is minimal energy usage, improving the sensor's battery life. Moreover, the GPS module in the sensor is programmed to wake up only when necessary, further saving power.

**5. Use Cases:**

The primary use case for the LANSITEC helmet sensor is in the field of construction and mining, where it serves both as a safety tool and a personnel tracking device. When an unusual movement is detected, the technology can alert supervisors or rescue teams. Additionally, the sensor can be used whenever worker safety or activity must be closely monitored, such as in manufacturing, factories, warehouses, or any industry where hazardous conditions may arise.

**6. Limitations:**

The LANSITEC helmet sensor may face limitations in areas with poor LoRaWAN coverage. As the device relies on signal coverage to transmit movement and fall alerts to the primary server, a lack of network coverage can leave the sensor unable to perform its primary functions. Furthermore, the sensor’s GPS tracking feature's accuracy relies on the drone's location being in view of sufficient satellites. In places where the receiver's view of the sky is obscured, such as in tunnels or dense urban areas, the GPS accuracy can considerably diminish.
