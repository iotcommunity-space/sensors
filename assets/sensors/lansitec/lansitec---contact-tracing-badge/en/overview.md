# LANSITEC - Contact Tracing Badge Documentation

## Overview

The LANSITEC Contact Tracing Badge (LANSITEC) is a sophisticated wearable IoT device, specifically engineered to facilitate advanced contact tracing and social distancing in various organizations. The device operates by utilizing Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) technologies in conjunction with LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) capabilities to enable efficient, real-time identification and tracking of individuals in different environments.

## Working Principles

LANSITEC operates by emitting BLE signals with a unique identifier. At the same time, it also scans for surrounding badges emitting similar signals. Any nearby badges detected via BLE are then sampled for RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indication) values, which is then used to estimate the distance between the badges. In case of a close contact event beyond the set safety parameters, this data is logged for future analysis and contact tracing. 

Furthermore, LANSITEC integrates with GNSS to provide geographical positioning information. These capabilities are used in sync with the LoRaWAN technology, enabling the transfer of the recorded data to a central system for monitoring and control through a LoRaWAN gateway.

## Installation Guide

LANSITEC deployment is relatively simple. These badges are wearable devices that can be fastened on clothes or worn around the neck. For setting up the communication, it’s imperative to ensure the presence of a LoRaWAN gateway within the operating radius of the badge for successful data transmission. 

After setup, the badge functions automatically, collecting data and sending this information via LoRaWAN communication to the central server. The information can then be visualized and analyzed using LANSITEC's platform or any third party that supports LoRaWAN protocols.

## LoRaWAN Details

The Contact Tracing Badge uses LoRaWAN – a media access control (MAC) layer protocol designed for large-scale public networks with a single operator. It's widely adopted in urban settings thanks to its long-range, low-power consumption characteristics. The built-in LoRa transceiver in LANSITEC badges communicates with a LoRaWAN gateway, which then transmits the data to a network server for further processing.

## Power Consumption

LANSITEC Contact Tracing Badges are designed to consume low power, owing to the use of BLE and LoRaWAN connectivity. The badges have a rechargeable battery that can last for several weeks depending on the usage scenario, effectively combining robust functionality with power efficiency.

## Use Cases

This Contact Tracing Badge can be deployed across a variety of sectors. It’s especially beneficial in places where tracking people’s movement and interactions are crucial for safety, such as manufacturing plants, offices, schools, hospitals, and other large gatherings. It also assists in real-time social distance monitoring and retrospective contact tracing, significantly aiding in pandemic situations to restrict the spread of communicable diseases.

## Limitations

Despite its robust functionality, there are few limitations to the badge. Accuracy can be affected in environments with many obstructions that interfere with the BLE signals. Since they are dependent on LoRaWAN for data communication, they are suitable only in areas with a LoRaWAN gateway. Also, while the device aids in contact tracing, it does not necessarily prevent the transmission of diseases. Hence, adherence to other safety measures is also crucial. Lastly, privacy concerns might arise due to the tracking nature of the device. 

This concludes the technical overview of LANSITEC - Contact Tracing Badge. Further details regarding the product specifications and operations need to be looked for in the respective user manual or product guide.
