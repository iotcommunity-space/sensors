Title: Technical Overview for LANSITEC - Tracking Label (LANSITEC)

### Introduction:
LANSITEC - Tracking Label is an advanced Internet of Things (IoT) location and data tracking label designed to facilitate efficient asset and data management. It takes advantage of LoRaWAN technology to provide long-range connectivity, along with a flexible and user-friendly functionality that suits a variety of applications.

### Working Principles:
This tracking label employs LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) technology, a protocol designed for wireless battery-operated devices in a wide area network. The working principle is based on capturing and transmitting data on assets' location and status to a central system for monitoring and analytics.

The tracking label leverages the LoRaWAN gateway to transmit captured data to a defined network server. The data is subsequently transferred to an application server, where real-time monitoring and analysis can be performed.

### Installation Guide:
To install and use the LANSITEC Tracking Label, follow the steps below:
1. First, register the device on your LoRaWAN network server using the provided unique identifier (devEUI) and application key (AppKey).
2. Then, attach the tracking labels to the assets to be monitored.
3. Finally, power up the labels and they will automatically connect to the LoRaWAN network and start sending data at preset intervals.

### LoRaWAN Details:
The tracking label uses class A LoRaWAN protocol, the most energy-efficient class, which supports bidirectional communication. It operates in several frequency bands including EU863-870, US902-928, AU915-928, AS923, CN470-510, and KR920-923. The data rate and transmission range depend on the LoRaWAN band in use and the environmental conditions, offering a maximum range of 15 km in suburban areas or 5 km in urban areas.

### Power Consumption:
The LANSITEC Tracking Label is designed to optimize energy usage, thanks to its low power LoRaWAN technology. It is powered by a 1000mAh battery, which can sustain the device for up to 5 years, depending on the data transmission frequency and environment.

### Use Cases:
1. Logistics: Monitor and track the location and status of goods in transit in real-time.
2. Asset Management: Track and manage the location of valuable assets in hospitals, factories, and offices.
3. Smart Agriculture: Information on environmental conditions such as soil moisture, temperature, can be monitored and used to optimize farming practices.

### Limitations:
1. LoRaWAN Range: The range may decrease in densely populated areas or in environments with physical barriers.
2. Dependence on LoRaWAN Network: The tracking label needs a working LoRaWAN network to function, which might limit its operation in areas where the network is unavailable.
3. Battery Life: While the battery life is enhanced by the low energy consumption of the LoRaWAN technology, frequent data transmission can deplete the battery quicker.
