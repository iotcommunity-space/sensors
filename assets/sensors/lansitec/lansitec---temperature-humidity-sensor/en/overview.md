# LANSITEC - Temperature Humidity Sensor Technical Overview

## Working Principles

The Lansitec Temperature Humidity Sensor is a highly sophisticated device that uses the principle of Relative Humidity (RH) and temperature measurement to monitor the environmental conditions of its immediate surroundings. The sensor operates by detecting changes in the electrical resistance of the Thin-Film Capacitor (TFC) or changes in the temperature on the Basis of Negative Temperature Coefficient (NTC) thermistor, depending upon the changes in the temperature and humidity in the air.

## Installation Guide

1. Remove the sensor from its packaging and place it in the desired location for monitoring.
   
2. Make sure the sensor is within range of a LoRa gateway, as its data transmission relies on LoRaWAN.

3. Connect the sensor with the gateway using the supplied setup interface.

4. Configure the sensor details on the gateway interface, such as its unique ID and other necessary parameters (like humidity and temperature threshold values).

5. After successful configuration and pairing, the sensor starts monitoring and transmitting data to the gateway.

## LoRaWAN Details

The Lansitec Temperature Humidity Sensor leverages the LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) technology to transmit recorded data to the gateway. It uses a three-layer architecture: application layer, network layer, and physical layer. The data rate ranges from 0.3 kbps to 50 kbps, supporting both line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight communication. The sensor ensures reliable, efficient, and secure data transmission over varying distances.

## Power Consumption

The Lansitec Sensor is designed with minimal power consumption in mind. The sensor operates using a 2400mAh lithium battery, which under normal use conditions, lasts three to ten years. The longevity depends on the specific transmission frequency and environmental conditions.

## Use Cases

The Lansitec Temperature Humidity Sensor can be used in various scenarios including:

1. Agriculture: Optimize conditions for crop growth with real-time data on temperature and humidity.

2. Warehouses: Monitor and maintain optimal conditions for stored goods.

3. Data Centers: Ensure the environment is suitable for equipment to run at optimal performance.

4. Smart Buildings: Improve HVAC systems efficiency and ensure comfort for occupants.

5. Healthcare Facilities: Monitor and maintain safe conditions for patient care and critical equipment.

## Limitations

1. The sensor must be within the radio range of a compatible LoRaWAN gateway for data transmission. 

2. The Temperature Humidity Sensor has a measurement range limit; temperature range is -20°C to +60°C and humidity ranging from 10% to 90% RH. 
 
3. The lifespan of the embedded battery depends heavily on the frequency of data transmission and environmental conditions, which might necessitate more frequent replacements in high-demand situations.

4. The sensor is not suitable for extremely harsh environmental conditions like high vibration spaces, excessively high or low temperature.

The Lansitec Temperature Humidity Sensor provides reliable, long-term monitoring of temperature and humidity conditions in a variety of settings, thanks to its durable construction, efficient power usage, and versatility. These traits, taken in tandem with LoRaWAN’s robust coverage, make it a viable solution in many IoT scenarios.
