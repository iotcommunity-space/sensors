Technical Overview â€“ LANSITEC Nb IoT Container Tracker

I. Introduction
The LANSITEC NB IoT (Narrowband Internet of Things) Container Tracker is a state-of-the-art tracking device that utilizes low-power, wide-area network technology to provide real-time location data and status of any stationary or mobile object, particularly containers.

II. Working Principles
The LANSITEC NB IoT Container Tracker primarily works on the principles of Narrowband IoT technology. It uses existing cellular network infrastructure and the NB-IoT protocol to transmit telemetry data from the container location to the receiving endpoint. The sensor gathers this data based on predefined criteria such as location change, light or shock trigger, or scheduled time interval. This data is then sent over the secure and reliable NB-IoT network.

III. Installation Guide
Despite its technological complexity, the LANSITEC NB IoT tracker is quite straightforward to install. It is usually affixed to the interior or exterior surface of the container using industrial-grade adhesive or mechanical fasteners such as screws. Readings are sent automatically once the device is turned on and has established a connection with the NB-IoT network.

IV. LoRaWAN Details
The LANSITEC Container Tracker can also operate on the LoRaWAN (Low Range Wide Area Network), which is a low-power, long-range, and low bandwidth networking solution. It provides multiple communication options with adaptable data rates that range from 0.3 kbps to 50 kbps.

V. Power Consumption
The LANSITEC NB IoT container tracker is highly optimized for ultra-low power consumption. Given the tracking frequency and network coverage, the device can operate for up to 5 years on a single battery charge.

VI. Use Cases
Use cases for this device abound in sectors where assets, particularly containers, require real-time monitoring. These sectors include logistics, supply chain management, maritime transport, manufacturing, agriculture, and even in security-related applications where tracking of assets is paramount.

VII. Limitations
Despite its many benefits, the LANSITEC NB IoT container tracker is not without limitations. These include: 

1. Limited Indoors Operation: Its performance can be significantly limited in indoor environments or dense urban localities due to poor reception of GPS signals.

2. Network Dependency: The device is dependent on the availability of a NB-IoT or LoRaWAN network. If the network is down or not available in the area, the device would not function as expected.

3. No Real-time Tracking: The tracker does not offer real-time tracking, as this would significantly reduce battery life. Instead, it provides location updates based on set intervals.

4. Preset Data Parameters: It operates on preset data transmission parameters. As such, it may not be suitable for scenarios requiring highly customizable data gathering and transmission strategies. 

In summary, the LANSITEC NB IoT Container Tracker is a premiere tracking solution for various industries, despite some limitations. Its longevity, reliability, and accessibility make it a great addition to optimize asset management and minimize risk exposure.
