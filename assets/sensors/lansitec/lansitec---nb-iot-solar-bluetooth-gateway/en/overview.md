**Technical Overview - LANSITEC - Nb IoT Solar Bluetooth Gateway (LANSITEC)** 

**Working Principle**

The LANSITEC Nb IoT Solar Bluetooth Gateway is a high-performing device designed to collect data from BLE devices and transmit this data to a cloud server through NB-IoT or LoRa networks. The working principle is rooted in Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology and Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) connectivity.

The gateway uses BLE to connect to devices in its proximity, allowing two-way communication and seamless data transmission. The NB-IoT or LoRaWAN module is employed to upload the scanned data to the cloud. LoRaWAN's wide area, low power network capability and NB-IoT's power efficiency and deep penetration ensure data can be sent even from remote or underground sites.

**Installation Guide**

The installation of the LANSITEC Solar Gateway is straightforward. 

1. Mount the solar panel at a location with adequate sunlight â€“ it should be south-facing.
2. Connect the solar panel to the Solar Gateway using the supplied cables.
3. Insert a SIM card if you intend to use NB-IoT.
4. Setup the LoRaWAN or NB-IoT parameters using the Configuration Tool.
5. Mount the device equidistant from the sensors you intend to connect it with.
6. Set the BLE devices to push data to the Gateway.

**LoRaWAN Details**

LoRaWAN is a long-range, low-power network protocol that allows devices to communicate over large distances without requiring much power. The LANSITEC Gateway leverages LoRaWAN to upload data to the cloud from the connected BLE devices. The Gateway uses standard LoRaWAN protocol, with network frequencies adjustable according to regional standards.

**Power Consumption**

The Nb IoT Solar Bluetooth Gateway has been built to be energy-efficient. While specific figures depend on the frequency of data transmissions, the device's operation is mainly powered by a solar panel, ensuring minimal additional power consumption. The Gateway enters a low-consumption state when no data interaction is happening.

**Use Cases**

The LANSITEC Nb IoT Solar Bluetooth Gateway is ideal for use cases where a large number of IoT devices need to be networked over a large area. These could include:

1. Asset Tracking: In large industries or warehouses, BLE beacons can be attached to assets and read via the Gateway.
2. Environment Monitoring: The Gateway can collect data from various environmental sensors placed over a large area.
3. Smart Agriculture: It can be used to network sensors that track soil health, crop health, livestock movements, etc.
4. Smart Cities: For networking various IoT devices ranging from traffic sensors to waste management units.

**Limitations**

While the Gateway guarantees excellent network range and power efficiency, certain limitations are inherent:

1. Connectivity: While LoRaWAN has a large range, it may still face connectivity issues in areas with physical obstructions or extremely remote locations.
2. Dependency: The device is reliant on sunlight for power, so performance could drop in low sunlight or overcast conditions.
3. Signal Interference: Since it operates on BLE, it might face signal interference in areas with a lot of electromagnetic activity.
4. Maintenance: Hardware maintenance can be challenging owing to the outdoor location of the device. 

In conclusion, the LANSITEC Nb IoT Solar Bluetooth Gateway offers a comprehensive solution for wide area IoT deployment with its energy-efficient and depth-penetrative operation.
