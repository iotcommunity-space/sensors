#### LANSITEC - Container Tracker (LANSITEC)

## Technical Overview

The LANSITEC - Container Tracker is an advanced tracking solution designed specifically for use within the shipping and storage industry. It employs a combination of multiple technologies including GPS and Low-Power Wide-Area Networking (LoRaWAN) to provide near real-time tracking & monitoring of containers.

## Working Principles

The Container Tracker primarily operates by obtaining GPS data to accurately pinpoint the location of your containers. The collected GPS data is then transmitted via the integrated LoRaWAN module to the central server. 

The tracker also incorporates a set of environment sensors to monitor temperature, humidity, and other essential parameters. These measurements are made regularly and transmitted alongside the location data.

## Installation Guide

Follow the below steps to install LANSITEC - Container Tracker:

1. **Device Placement:**
   Install the LANSITEC - Container Tracker on the container using the appropriate mounting hardware provided. Preferred installation locations could be either at the top of the container or the side where the device can receive the GPS signal properly.

2. **Network Connectivity:**
   Ensure the device is within the range of your LoRaWAN network. If required, a signal repeater may be used to ensure a strong and stable connection to the network.

3. **Device Activation:**
   Once in place, use the provided software application to activate the device, configure sensor report intervals, and set up any necessary alarms or notifications.

4. **Data Verification:**
   Before the full-scale operation, ensure you can view and monitor the container's location and environmental data correctly from the central server.

## LoRaWAN Details

The LANSITEC - Container Tracker utilises the LoRaWAN technology that uses low power, wide-area networks to transmit data over long ranges. The tracker connects to the LoRaWAN network using specific frequencies (868 MHz in EU or 915 MHz in US) depending on the region of deployment.

## Power Consumption

The LANSITEC - Container Tracker is designed to operate efficiently and minimally affect battery life. It consumes power from its internal battery mainly during GPS data collection and transmission over the LoRaWAN network. The power consumption can be optimised through software by adjusting the frequency of data collection and transmission.

## Use Cases

The Container Tracker finds application mainly in logistics and container leasing/renting companies. It's used to monitor the real-time locations of their containers and ensure the safety and integrity of the goods inside through environmental monitoring. 

## Limitations

While the LANSITEC - Container Tracker offers many benefits, it does have a few limitations.

1. **GPS Signal Interruptions**
The device requires a clear line of sight to the sky to obtain an accurate GPS location. Therefore, the signal may be interrupted or weakened in densely built-up areas or enclosed places.

2. **Range of LoRaWAN Network**
The device must be within the range of the LoRaWAN network to transmit data effectively. This range may vary depending on several factors such as landscape and building structure.

3. **Environmental Conditions**
Extreme environmental conditions may affect the battery life and longevity of the device, especially in corrosive conditions or harsh sea weather conditions.

4. **Battery Replacement**
Considering that the device relies on an internal battery, the need for eventual battery replacement over time should be considered. This can create additional cost and maintenance.

In spite of these limitations, the LANSITEC - Container Tracker provides comprehensive and efficient container tracking solution, ensuring enhanced visibility and control for your logistic requirements.
