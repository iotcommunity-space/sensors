**Technical Overview for LANSITEC - Precision Platinum Sensor (LANSITEC)**

**1. Working Principles:**

The LANSITEC Precision Platinum Sensor operates via the principle of resistance temperature detection (RTD) using platinum. This sensor operates by measuring the resistance changes of the platinum element inside the sensor as the temperature changes. Its advanced microelectronic design and exclusive RTD (Resistance Temperature Detector) technology provide high accuracy and excellent long-term stability.

**2. Installation Guide:**

- Switch off all power supplying equipment before installation.
- Mount the sensor in your desired location. Make sure the location is away from direct sunlight and sources of unnecessary heat or cold.
- Connect the sensor input port to the device for recording temperature readings.
- Ensure that the sensor wires are correctly color-coded before connecting them to the controller or other peripheral devices.
- Care should be taken to avoid any physical damage to the sensor during the installation process.
- After the installation, power on the equipment to start operating the sensor.

**3. LoRaWAN Details:**

The LANSITEC Precision Platinum Sensor utilizes Low Power Wide Area Network (LoRaWan) technology for data transmission. LoRaWAN is a media access control (MAC) layer protocol for managing communication between LPWAN gateways and end-node devices. The sensor nodes can communicate directly with the LoRaWAN gateway, which is ideal for IoT functionality and efficiency. 

The device supports different LoRaWAN frequency bands which makes it suitable for global use. The default LoRaWAN class is A, which can be changed through downlink on userâ€™s request.

**4. Power Consumption:**

This sensor exhibits extremely low power consumption, making it an optimal choice for long-term and constant monitoring applications. Powered by a 2400mAh Li-SOCl2 battery, it allows for a battery lifespan of greater than three years depending on the specific data transmission interval.

**5. Use Cases:**

The LANSITEC Precision Platinum Sensor finds applications in various sectors. Due to its high accuracy and stability, it is widely used in areas such as:

- Industrial process monitoring and control.
- Refrigerator temperature monitoring.
- Greenhouse environmental supervision.
- Field environmental monitoring.
- Cold chain logistics.

**6. Limitations:**

- The sensor's performance may be affected by mechanical stress or vibration, improper installation, and corrosive atmospheres.
- It performs optimally within a specific temperature range; its accuracy might drop if it's operated outside this range.
- The LoRaWAN technology only allows for data communication to a limited distance.
- Its power efficiency may deplete with an increase in data transmission frequency.
