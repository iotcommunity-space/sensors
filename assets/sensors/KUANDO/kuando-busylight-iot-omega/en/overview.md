# KUANDO - Busylight IoT Omega (KUANDO) Technical Overview

## Introduction
The KUANDO Busylight IoT Omega is an advanced indicator light designed for modern workplace environments and industrial settings. Leveraging IoT connectivity, this device provides visual alerts to manage workflow, indicate presence, and streamline communication. Integrated with LoRaWAN technology, it offers wireless communication capabilities suitable for both short and long-range applications.

## Working Principles
The KUANDO device functions as an occupancy and status indicator that visually conveys different signals through its multi-color LED light configuration. Its core principle relies on connectivity through LoRaWAN, enabling remote control and monitoring via a central network. The device can be programmed to display varying light patterns and colors to signify different statuses such as availability, busy status, alerts, and emergency situations. 

## Installation Guide

1. **Unboxing and Initial Setup**:
   - Carefully unbox the KUANDO Busylight IoT Omega device, ensuring all components (light unit, power adapter, mounting kit) are included.
   - Charge the device for at least 2 hours before initial use if it comes with a rechargeable battery option.

2. **Physical Installation**:
   - Select an appropriate mounting location ensuring visibility and accessibility.
   - Use the included mounting kit to secure the device on the wall or desk as per the requirements.

3. **Power Connection**:
   - Connect the device to a power source using the provided adapter or ensure the battery is properly installed and charged for battery-operated models.

4. **Network Configuration**:
   - Download the KUANDO configuration app on your smartphone or computer.
   - Follow the prompt in the app to connect the device to the local network, selecting LoRaWAN as the connectivity protocol.

5. **LoRaWAN Setup**:
   - Enter the necessary LoRaWAN credentials which include Device EUI (DevEUI), Application EUI (AppEUI), and Application Key (AppKey), usually provided by your network provider.

6. **Testing and Calibration**:
   - Test the light signals using the app to ensure proper functioning.
   - Calibrate the device settings to suit environmental and organizational needs. Set custom alerts and decide on the color codes for different statuses.

## LoRaWAN Details
- **Frequency Band**: The KUANDO Busylight IoT Omega typically supports EU868, US915, or AU915 frequency bands, depending on regional requirements.
- **Communication Range**: In ideal conditions, the device can communicate over a range of up to 10 kilometers (6.2 miles), although range can vary depending on environmental obstructions.
- **Network Integration**: The device supports seamless integration with existing LoRaWAN gateways and network servers, enabling scalable deployment in large environments.

## Power Consumption
- **Typical Power Usage**: When powered via an electrical outlet, the KUANDO device has a typical power consumption of around 2 watts.
- **Battery Life**: In battery operation mode, lifespan depends on usage, with around 6-12 months of battery life under standard operational conditions with sporadic usage.

## Use Cases
- **Office Environments**: Indicating employee availability and helping reduce interruptions.
- **Manufacturing Floors**: Visual signal for machine status, emergency alerts, and workflow notifications.
- **Healthcare**: Signaling patient room statuses, nurse calls, and other critical notifications.
- **Remote Working Environments**: Used by remote teams to indicate online presence and ongoing meeting statuses.

## Limitations
- **Line of Sight**: Although it offers a substantial range, the communication efficiency can be compromised by dense walls and heavy obstructions.
- **Network Dependency**: Operations are reliant on stable LoRaWAN network connectivity; disruptions in service can impact device functionality.
- **Integration Challenges**: Initial setup and integration with existing systems might require technical expertise, particularly for extensive configurations.
- **Power Source Limitations**: Where continuous operation is essential, reliance on battery power might be a constraint, demanding frequent monitoring and recharging/replacement.
