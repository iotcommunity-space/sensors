## Working Principles

MIOTIQ operates on the LoRaWAN protocol, which enables low-power, wide-area networking for battery-operated devices. It is equipped with a suite of customizable sensors (e.g., temperature, humidity, pressure, and gas detectors) allowing it to cater to specific use cases. The device collects environmental data and transmits it over LoRaWAN to a central gateway, which forwards the data to the cloud for analysis and visualization.

### Key Features:

- **Customizable Sensor Modules**: Users can tailor sensor suites according to specific application needs.
- **LoRaWAN Connectivity**: Provides extensive range and network redundancy.
- **Configurable Transmission Interval**: Balances data granularity with battery longevity.
- **Data Encryption**: Ensures secure transmission with AES-128 encryption.

   - Identify the sensor modules required for your application.
   - Ensure LoRaWAN gateway coverage in the deployment area.
   - Prepare mounting tools appropriate for the installation environment.

2. **Physical Mounting**:
   - Position the sensor based on application requirements (e.g., at a certain height for environmental monitoring).
   - Securely attach the device to the chosen surface using mounting brackets or industrial adhesive.

3. **Configuration**:
   - Utilize the MIOTIQ configuration software to set up device parameters such as data transmission intervals and specific sensor calibrations.
   - Pair the device with the LoRaWAN gateway following the on-screen instructions.

4. **Network Integration**:
   - Register the device's unique identifier (EUI) with the LoRaWAN network server.
   - Configure necessary network settings such as Device Address, App EUI, App Key for secure communication.

5. **Testing**:
   - Ensure the sensor is correctly communicating with the network by checking for data receipt on the server.
   - Validate sensor readings for accuracy.
