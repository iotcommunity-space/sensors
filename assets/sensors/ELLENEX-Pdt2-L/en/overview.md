### Technical Overview for ELLENEX - Pdt2 L

#### Introduction
The ELLENEX Pdt2 L is a compact and robust pressure transmitter designed for remote monitoring of fluid pressure in various industrial applications. It utilizes LoRaWAN communication technology, allowing for long-range data transmission with low power consumption, making it ideal for integration in IoT systems, particularly in locations where conventional networks may not be feasible.

#### Working Principles
The Pdt2 L operates by converting physical pressure measurements into electronic signals. It typically features a piezoresistive sensing element, which changes resistance in response to applied pressure. The sensor is calibrated to output a proportional electrical signal, which the onboard electronics convert into digital data. This data is then transmitted via the LoRaWAN network to a central server or gateway for further analysis and visualization.

#### Installation Guide
1. **Site Preparation:** Ensure the deployment location has stable, minimal vibration and is within the operating temperature range. Consider access to a LoRaWAN gateway for optimal signal transmission.
   
2. **Mounting:** Secure the sensor using appropriate mounting brackets or flanges compatible with the process connection. The installation orientation should minimize mechanical stress and ensure ease of maintenance.

3. **Electrical Connection:** Connect the sensor's wiring to a power source according to the specified voltage input, typically in low-voltage DC, and ensure it is within operational limits.

4. **Network Configuration:**
   - Power up the sensor and use the manufacturer's software tools or a compatible LoRaWAN network server to configure device parameters such as Device EUI, Application EUI, and App Key.
   - Enroll the device into the LoRaWAN network, ensuring that it is properly registered, which typically involves inputting these unique identifiers into the network server.
   - Perform a connectivity test to verify data transmission and reception.

5. **Calibration and Testing:** Upon installation, perform calibration checks against known pressure standards to ensure accuracy. Run a full diagnostic to guarantee functional integrity.

#### LoRaWAN Details
- **Frequency Bands:** The Pdt2 L supports multiple regional frequency bands (e.g., EU868, US915), complying with local regulations.
- **Data Rates:** Utilizes adaptive data rate (ADR) for optimizing the data rate and power consumption based on signal strength and gateway distance.
- **Range:** Capable of transmitting over several kilometers in rural areas; range may reduce in urban settings due to obstructions.
- **Security:** Implements AES-128 encryption at both the network and application layers ensuring data integrity and security.

#### Power Consumption
The ELLENEX Pdt2 L is designed for low power consumption, making it suitable for battery-powered operation. It often employs energy-saving modes, such as sleep mode, to extend battery life significantly—typically functioning for several years on a single battery pack, depending on transmission frequency and environmental conditions.

#### Use Cases
- **Water Treatment Plants:** Monitoring pressure in filtration and distribution systems.
- **Oil and Gas Industry:** Pressure monitoring in pipelines and storage tanks to ensure system integrity.
- **Agriculture:** Measurement of pressure in irrigation systems for efficient water use.
- **Smart Cities:** Integration into municipal infrastructure for monitoring and automation of pressure-dependent systems.

#### Limitations
- **Environmental Restrictions:** The device must be installed within its specified environmental limits (typically -40°C to +85°C). Exposure beyond this range can result in inaccurate readings or damage.
- **Network Dependency:** Requires a functional LoRaWAN network for data transmission. Poor network infrastructure may lead to data loss.
- **Data Transmission Limitations:** LoRaWAN's limitations in bandwidth necessitate that data transmission is concise, potentially impacting rapidly changing pressure environments.
- **Physical Installation Constraints:** The sensor's performance depends on proper installation; incorrect orientation or mounting can lead to inaccurate pressure readings.

In summary, the ELLENEX Pdt2 L provides reliable pressure sensing for industrial IoT applications with its robust design and low power LoRaWAN communication capabilities. Proper installation and network setup are crucial for optimal performance, with potential limitations primarily associated with environmental and network factors.
