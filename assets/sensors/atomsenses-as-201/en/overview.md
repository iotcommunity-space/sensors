### ATOMSENSES - As 201 Technical Overview

---

#### Introduction
The ATOMSENSES - As 201 is an advanced IoT sensor device designed to monitor environmental parameters with precision and reliability. Utilizing the LoRaWAN communication protocol, the As 201 is optimized for low-power operations, making it suitable for deployment in remote and dispersed locations.

#### Working Principles
ATOMSENSES - As 201 leverages a combination of MEMS and optical sensors to measure parameters such as temperature, humidity, particulate matter, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Here’s a brief overview of how the sensors function:

- **Temperature and Humidity:** Utilizes MEMS-based capacitive sensors for high accuracy in recording ambient conditions.
- **Particulate Matter Detection:** An optical IR LED and photodetector arrangement identifies and measures PM2.5 and PM10 particle concentrations in the air.
- **VOCs Measurement:** Employs photoionization detectors to gauge VOC concentration, offering insights into air quality.

#### Installation Guide
1. **Site Preparation:** Choose a site free from obstructions and direct exposure to elements like rain or excessive solar radiation. For optimal readings, position the sensor at least 1.5 to 2 meters above ground.

2. **Mounting:** Secure the sensor using the provided wall-mount or pole-mount brackets. Ensure the sensor is in a vertical position to allow proper air circulation.

3. **Power Setup:** Connect to a suitable power source as defined in the power specifications (battery or solar options are available).

4. **Activation and Configuration:**
   - Utilize the ATOMSENSES mobile app via Bluetooth for initial setup.
   - Configure the device to connect with the desired LoRaWAN network by inputting the network credentials (AppEUI, AppKey, DeviceEUI).

5. **Calibration:** Perform an initial calibration routine through the app to synchronize with defined environmental baselines.

#### LoRaWAN Details
- **Frequency Bands:** Supports standard LoRaWAN frequency bands suitable for global deployment (e.g., EU868, US915, AS923).
- **Network Join Procedure:** Utilizes Over-the-Air Activation (OTAA) for secure network integration.
- **Data Transmission:** Data packets are sent in defined intervals, which can be adjusted through the configuration interface to balance between update frequency and battery life.
- **Security:** Implements 128-bit AES encryption to ensure data integrity and privacy.

#### Power Consumption
- **Idle State:** 10 µA
- **Active Transmission:** 30 mA
- **Average Operation (standard configuration):** ~0.2 mWh per day
- **Power Sources:** Operates on either a rechargeable lithium battery or solar power unit, providing up to 18 months of continuous operation on a single charge cycle (battery dependent).

#### Use Cases
- **Environmental Monitoring:** Ideal for air quality monitoring in urban areas, providing real-time data to municipal systems for air quality management.
- **Agricultural Applications:** Useful for monitoring climatic conditions in agricultural settings, ensuring crop health and optimizing irrigation systems.
- **Industrial Facilities:** Facilitates detection of hazardous atmospheric conditions, enhancing workplace safety and regulatory compliance.

#### Limitations
- **Line-of-sight Required:** LoRaWAN’s range can be significantly reduced by obstacles such as buildings or dense foliage.
- **Data Latency:** While LoRaWAN is efficient for periodic data transmission, it is not suitable for applications requiring real-time data streams due to inherent latency.
- **Maintenance Needs:** Though low maintenance, sensors may require periodic recalibration and cleaning to maintain accuracy, especially in dusty or polluted environments.

ATOMSENSES - As 201 sets a benchmark for IoT environmental sensors, balancing detailed data collection with efficient use of resources, suitable for a broad range of monitoring applications.
