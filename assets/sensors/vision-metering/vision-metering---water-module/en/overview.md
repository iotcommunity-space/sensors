## VISION-METERING - Water Module Overview

The VISION-METERING - Water Module is a state-of-the-art IoT device specifically designed for the remote monitoring of water usage in residential, commercial, and industrial applications. Leveraging LoRaWAN connectivity, this module enables utilities and property managers to enhance their metering infrastructure with reliable, long-range communication and low-power operation.

### Working Principles

The VISION-METERING - Water Module operates by interfacing with existing water meters to collect and transmit usage data. It typically connects to a reed switch output of a pulse-generating water meter, capturing each revolution of the meter's dial as a discrete pulse correlated to a fixed volume of water. The module then accumulates these pulses and periodically transmits the total to a LoRaWAN gateway.

#### Key Components:
- **Reed Switch Interface:** Captures mechanical pulses from the water meter.
- **Microcontroller:** Processes and stores collected pulse data.
- **LoRaWAN Transceiver:** Transmits data to a network gateway using the LoRaWAN protocol.
- **Battery:** Provides long-term power supply for autonomous operation.

### Installation Guide

1. **Preparation:**
   - Confirm compatibility with the water meter model.
   - Ensure access to a nearby LoRaWAN gateway for connectivity testing.

2. **Physical Installation:**
   - Securely mount the module using the included bracket or adhesive near the water meter.
   - Ensure the device is positioned for optimal signal transmission and reception.
   - Connect the reed switch wire to the designated terminal on the module.

3. **Electrical Connection:**
   - Verify battery installation or connect an external power source if specified.
   - Initiate the module by following the device's power-on sequence.

4. **Configuration:**
   - Program the module using the accompanying software or mobile app to set communication parameters and calibration details.
   - Test connectivity by ensuring the device is sending data to the gateway.

5. **Testing:**
   - Confirm correct data transmission by comparing periodic readings with expected water usage.
   - Adjust settings as necessary to ensure accurate monitoring.

### LoRaWAN Details

- **Frequency Bands:** Compatible with regional LoRaWAN frequency plans (e.g., EU868, US915).
- **Data Rate:** Supports adaptive data rate (ADR) for efficient bandwidth usage.
- **Network Architecture:** Operates in a star-of-stars topology, connecting directly to a gateway that bridges to a network server and backend systems.
- **Security Features:** Utilizes AES-128 encryption for secure data transmission.

### Power Consumption

The VISION-METERING - Water Module is engineered for ultra-low power operation, enabling extended battery life:

- **Battery Life:** Typically up to 10 years, depending on transmission frequency and environmental conditions.
- **Sleeping Current:** Typically below 10ÂµA in quiescent states.
- **Transmission Current:** Spikes to several milliamps during data bursts.

### Use Cases

- **Residential Water Monitoring:** Allows homeowners to track water consumption and identify potential leaks.
- **Utility Billing:** Provides utilities with accurate, real-time data for billing and supply management.
- **Leak Detection and Alarming:** Facilitates rapid detection of abnormal water usage patterns, signaling potential leaks.
- **Industrial Water Management:** Supports complex facility monitoring, optimizing resource allocation and conservation efforts.

### Limitations

- **Signal Range:** Performance can degrade in environments with significant physical obstructions or electromagnetic interference, requiring careful planning of LoRaWAN infrastructure.
- **Data Frequency:** Configured for periodic data transmission, limiting the granularity of real-time monitoring.
- **Meter Compatibility:** Requires pulse-enabled water meters; incompatible with meters lacking appropriate output.
- **Environmental Constraints:** Performance can be affected by extreme temperatures or submersion beyond specified limits.

The VISION-METERING - Water Module is a robust solution for enhancing water data acquisition, providing stakeholders with powerful tools for analysis and resource management. However, its deployment should be carefully planned to account for environmental and infrastructural variables to ensure optimal functionality.
