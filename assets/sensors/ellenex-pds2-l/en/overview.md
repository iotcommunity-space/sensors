# Technical Overview of ELLENEX - Pds2 L Sensor

## Introduction
The ELLENEX Pds2 L is a robust IoT-enabled differential pressure sensor designed to monitor pressure changes in various industrial and environmental applications. Its integration with LoRaWAN technology allows for wireless long-range communication, making it a versatile solution for remote monitoring without the need for extensive infrastructure.

## Working Principles
The Pds2 L operates on the principle of differential pressure measurement, which involves measuring the pressure difference between two points. The device uses a sensitive diaphragm and precision sensors to detect pressure changes with high accuracy. The differential pressure is converted to an electrical signal, which is then processed and transmitted wirelessly via LoRaWAN. This ensures low latency and reliable data transmission in diverse conditions.

## Installation Guide

### Mounting
1. **Location Selection**: Ensure the sensor is placed where it is protected from physical damage and within the operating environment specifications.
2. **Orientation**: The sensor should be mounted in a stable position to avoid vibrations that may affect readings.
3. **Connection Ports**: Attach the input pressure ports securely using compatible fittings and seals to prevent leaks.

### Electrical Connection
1. **Battery Installation**: Insert the specified battery type following the polarity marks. The device is designed for low power consumption to extend battery life.
2. **Wiring**: If applicable, connect any wired components following the wiring diagram provided in the user manual.

### Configuration
1. **Activation**: Power on the device and check the LED indicators to ensure proper operation.
2. **Network Joining**: Ensure the sensor is within range of a LoRaWAN gateway. Configure the device with the correct network credentials (AppEUI, DevEUI, AppKey) through the provided interface or using Over-the-Air Activation (OTAA).

## LoRaWAN Details
The Pds2 L employs LoRaWAN, a Low Power Wide Area Networking protocol specifically designed for bidirectional communication over long distances. Key attributes include:
- **Frequency Bands**: Operates on standard frequencies (e.g., EU868, US915) depending on regional requirements.
- **Data Rate**: Supports adaptive data rate to optimize coverage and battery life.
- **Security**: Implements end-to-end encryption to protect data from sensor to server.
- **Configuration**: Compatible with standard LoRaWAN network servers for ease of integration.

## Power Consumption
The Pds2 L is optimized for low power consumption, enabling long-term deployment without frequent maintenance. It features:
- **Sleep Mode**: Activates when no measurements are scheduled or network activity is detected, significantly reducing power use.
- **Activation Current**: Minimal current draw on startup, maximizing battery life.
- **Operating Life**: Extended battery life under typical measurement and reporting intervals, often exceeding several years depending on configuration and environment.

## Use Cases
- **Industrial Monitoring**: Ideal for pressure monitoring in pipelines and containers to ensure safe and efficient operation.
- **Environmental Applications**: Suitable for monitoring atmospheric pressure differences in environmental research.
- **Building Management**: Monitors HVAC systems for optimal performance and maintenance.
- **Water Management**: Used in water distribution networks to detect leaks or pressure changes.

## Limitations
- **Operating Environment**: The sensorâ€™s performance may degrade in extreme temperature or humidity conditions outside specified limits.
- **Range Limitation**: While capable of long-range transmission, physical obstructions and environmental factors can affect LoRaWAN signal strength and range.
- **Battery Dependency**: Although designed for low power consumption, battery life will vary based on frequency of use and environmental conditions, necessitating eventual replacement or recharging.
- **Calibration**: May require periodic calibration to maintain accuracy, especially in environments with fluctuating conditions.

In summary, the ELLENEX Pds2 L is a versatile differential pressure sensor that combines precision measurement capabilities with the extended communication range of LoRaWAN. It is well-suited for a variety of applications, from industrial to environmental, provided its limitations are carefully managed.
