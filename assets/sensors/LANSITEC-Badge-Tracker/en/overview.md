# LANSITEC - Badge Tracker Technical Overview

The LANSITEC Badge Tracker is a compact IoT device designed to facilitate real-time location tracking and monitoring. It is ideal for indoor asset tracking, workforce management, and safety compliance applications. This document provides a comprehensive technical overview, including its working principles, installation guide, LoRaWAN details, power consumption metrics, potential use cases, and limitations.

## Working Principles

The LANSITEC Badge Tracker operates primarily on the LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) protocol, enabling long-range communication with minimal power usage. The device regularly transmits its location and status data to a central LoRaWAN gateway, which then forwards this information to a network server. The server processes the data, making it accessible through dashboards or integrated applications for end-user interaction.

Key components utilized in the device's operation include:
- **LoRa Transceiver**: Facilitates long-distance data transmission with low power consumption.
- **GPS Module**: Provides outdoor positioning data.
- **Accelerometer**: Detects motion and provides activity status information.
- **User Interface**: LEDs and buttons for status indication and manual operation.

## Installation Guide

1. **Unboxing and Inspection**: Carefully remove the tracker from its packaging and inspect it for any physical damage.
   
2. **Charging the Device**: Use a compatible USB charger to fully charge the device before initial use.

3. **Activation and Configuration**:
   - Activate the device by pressing the power button.
   - Use a LoRaWAN configuration tool or software provided by LANSITEC to configure network settings such as Device EUI, App EUI, and App Key.
   - Ensure the configured settings match those of the LoRa network to which the device will connect.

4. **Mounting**:
   - The badge tracker can be worn using a lanyard or attached to an item using adhesive pads.
   - Ensure that the environment is compliant with the device’s operational parameters (operating temperature range, humidity levels, etc.).

5. **Testing**: Verify the tracker’s connection to the network by checking data transmission logs and location updates.

## LoRaWAN Details

- **Frequency Bands**: The device operates on multiple frequency bands, supporting global LoRaWAN standards.
- **Transmission Power**: Configurable power settings that adhere to regional regulations to maximize range and minimize interference.
- **Data Rate**: Supports adaptive data rate to balance energy consumption with distance and density of nodes.

## Power Consumption

The LANSITEC Badge Tracker is designed for efficiency, leveraging LoRa’s low-power capabilities:
- **Idle Mode**: Ultra-low power state when not transmitting or receiving data.
- **Transmission Mode**: The device consumes more power during data transmission, especially when GPS positioning is active.
- **Battery Life**: Depending on configuration and usage frequency, the battery can last from several days to several weeks on a full charge.

## Use Cases

- **Asset Tracking**: Monitor the location of valuable assets within large facilities such as warehouses and manufacturing plants.
- **Workforce Management**: Track employee movements to ensure safety and efficiency in environments such as construction sites and hospitals.
- **Safety Compliance**: Support applications for safety protocols, emergency evacuations, and lone-worker protection.

## Limitations

While versatile, the LANSITEC Badge Tracker has certain limitations:
- **Indoor vs. Outdoor Use**: GPS accuracy may be less reliable indoors where signals may be obstructed.
- **Network Dependency**: The device requires a reliable LoRaWAN network to function optimally.
- **Battery Limitations**: Extensive use of GPS and frequent transmission events can significantly reduce battery life.
