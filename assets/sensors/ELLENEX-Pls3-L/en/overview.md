## Technical Overview of ELLENEX - Pls3 L

### Introduction
The ELLENEX - Pls3 L is a precision level sensor designed for applications requiring accurate monitoring of liquid levels. This device leverages LoRaWAN technology to provide a long-range, low-power solution suitable for various industrial and environmental monitoring applications.

### Working Principles
The ELLENEX - Pls3 L utilizes a capacitive level sensing mechanism. It measures the change in capacitance as the liquid level varies in a tank or container, providing electronic output proportional to the level of the liquid. The internal circuitry converts these measurements into digital signals which are transmitted via LoRaWAN to a centralized monitoring system.

### Installation Guide
1. **Pre-Installation Checks:**
   - Ensure compatibility with the liquid type.
   - Confirm that the environmental conditions are within the sensorâ€™s operational range.
   
2. **Mounting:**
   - Install the sensor vertically to avoid measurement errors.
   - Secure the sensor at the desired depth using mounting brackets or flanges.

3. **Wiring:**
   - Follow the wiring diagram provided in the user manual.
   - Ensure that the power supply is connected correctly based on the voltage specifications.

4. **Configuration:**
   - Set up the sensor ID and LoRaWAN parameters such as DevEUI, AppEUI, and AppKey.
   - Use the provided configuration tool or software interface to calibrate the sensor against known liquid levels.

5. **Testing:**
   - Perform a functional check by filling or emptying the tank to verify sensor accuracy.
   - Ensure data is being transmitted and received by the LoRaWAN network properly.

### LoRaWAN Details
- **Frequency Bands:** The Pls3 L operates on multiple frequency bands depending on the region, such as EU868, US915, or AS923.
- **Communication Range:** Capable of transmitting data over several kilometers, depending on the terrain and network infrastructure.
- **Network Architecture:** Utilizes a star topology connecting the sensor node to one or more gateway(s), which relay data to a network server.
- **Data Transmission:** Supports both Class A and Class C devices for asynchronous and continuous communication capabilities.

### Power Consumption
- **Battery Life:** Operating on a long-lasting lithium battery, with an average lifespan of 5 to 10 years depending on data transmission frequency and environmental factors.
- **Sleep Mode:** Integrated low-power sleep mode significantly reduces consumption during idle periods.

### Use Cases
- **Water Treatment Plants:** Monitor levels in settling tanks and reservoirs.
- **Agriculture:** Manage irrigation systems by tracking storage tank levels.
- **Oil and Gas:** Inventory management in fuel storage and chemical processing facilities.
- **Flood Control:** Integrate into early warning systems for flood-prone areas.

### Limitations
- **Accuracy Limitations:** The measurement accuracy can be affected by foam, floating debris, or rapid changes in liquid levels.
- **Environmental Constraints:** Designed to function within specific temperature and humidity ranges; exposure beyond these can lead to inaccuracies or damage.
- **Material Compatibility:** Suitable mostly for non-corrosive liquids under defined pressure limits.
- **Network Dependence:** Data transmission is subject to LoRaWAN network availability and coverage.

### Conclusion
The ELLENEX - Pls3 L combines precision sensing with IoT connectivity to offer a robust solution for liquid level monitoring across various sectors. By understanding its operation, installation, and limitations, users can maximize the effectiveness and reliability of this advanced sensor technology.
