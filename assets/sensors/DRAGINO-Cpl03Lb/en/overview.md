# Technical Overview for DRAGINO - CPL03-LB

The DRAGINO CPL03-LB is a Compact Professional LoRaWAN Leaf Wetness and Air Temperature/Humidity Sensor designed for precision agriculture and environmental monitoring applications. The sensor integrates best-in-class leaf wetness and air temperature/humidity sensors to provide accurate and reliable data over a long range using the LoRaWAN protocol.

## Working Principles

The CPL03-LB utilizes a capacitive leaf wetness sensor along with a digital temperature and humidity sensor to monitor environmental conditions accurately. The leaf wetness sensor gauges the water film, or dew, present on a leaf surface, which is essential for understanding fungal risks and irrigation needs. The temperature and humidity sensor measures the ambient conditions, providing crucial data for various agricultural practices.

The sensor collects data at set intervals, which is transmitted via LoRaWAN to a compatible gateway. The raw data is sent through the network to cloud-based applications that process and visualize the data for end-user analysis.

## Installation Guide

1. **Unpacking and Setup:**
   - Carefully unpack the sensor.
   - Ensure all components are present, including the sensor probe, main unit, mounting hardware, and antenna.

2. **Physical Installation:**
   - Select a suitable location where the leaf wetness sensor can closely mimic actual leaf conditions. Ideally, position it at plant canopy height.
   - Secure the sensor using the provided mounting hardware, ensuring it is stable and free from obstructions that may cause rain shadows or wind interference.
   - Attach the external antenna to the main unit.

3. **Powering the Sensor:**
   - Insert batteries according to the indicated polarity (use high-quality lithium batteries for optimal results).
   - Check the device for correct operation; a brief LED indicator may signal power-on status.

4. **LoRaWAN Configuration:**
   - Use a USB to UART converter to access the device configuration via a PC terminal.
   - Configure the device for LoRaWAN by entering the necessary device EUI, application keys, and other network parameters as per your LoRaWAN network server.
   - Ensure the device is set to the proper frequency band matching your geographic region.

5. **Activation and Testing:**
   - Activate the sensor through Over The Air Activation (OTAA) or Activation By Personalization (ABP) as required by your network.
   - Perform a test transmission to confirm the data is being correctly received at the gateway.
