- Download and familiarize yourself with the necessary software tools and LoRaWAN network configurations.

### Installation Steps

1. **Hardware Setup**:
   - Place the sensor in the designated monitoring area. Ensure it is secured and shielded from direct exposure to harsh environmental conditions unless specified for outdoor use.
   - Connect any external power sources if applicable, although the sensor might come with an integrated battery.

2. **Power On**: 
   - Activate the sensor using the power button or by connecting to a power source. Check the indicator LED for the status.

3. **Configuration**:
   - Using the provided software tool, configure sensor thresholds, data acquisition intervals, and other required parameters.
   - Set up the LoRaWAN parameters such as Device EUI, Application Key, and Network Session Key.

4. **Gateway Registration**:
   - Register the sensor with a LoRaWAN gateway by inputting the necessary credentials provided by your LoRaWAN network server.

5. **Testing**:
   - Conduct a test transmission to verify successful communication with the LoRaWAN network. Ensure data is correctly received on your end platform or application.
