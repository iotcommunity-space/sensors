## Overview for RAK - 2171 Wisnode Trackit (RAK)

**1. Working Principles:**
The RAK - 2171 is a versatile Wisnode Trackit device capable of providing location information over long distances using GPS for pinpoint accuracy and a low-power, wide-area network (LoRaWAN) for transmission. It is powered by the RAK811 module, which handles the LoRaWAN protocol communication. Through its integrated accelerometer, the RAK - 2171 can also provide movement data.

**2. Installation Guide:**
The RAK - 2171 comes with a complete and easy to install kit. After unboxing the device, you can attach it via its mount on any object whose position you want to track. Connecting it to a node on a LoRaWAN network is effortless. After powering on the device, select the appropriate region and frequency in the provided configuration app (RAKwireless LoRa Technology). The device configurations can be done using AT commands connecting the device using micro USB port.

**3. LoRaWAN Details:**
In compliance with LoRaWAN 1.0.2 protocol, the RAK -2171 operates in various frequency plans suitable for global use, including EU868, US915, AS923, CN470, and more. The LoRaWAN protocol allows for long-range communication (up to 15 km in rural areas and 5 km in urban areas) while keeping power consumption low. On the network, the RAK - 2171 can operate in classes A and C.

**4. Power Consumption:**
The RAK â€“ 2171 is optimized for low power consumption, with an advanced power management system that minimizes battery use during inactivity or when a stationary status is detected by the accelerometer. Its LoRaWan Class A compliance also contributes to this lower consumption by allowing it to sleep between transmissions, making it possible for the device to operate for a few years with a single 3.7 V rechargeable Li-ion battery.

**5. Use Cases:**
The RAK - 2171 can be used to track the whereabouts of any object, from vehicles to livestock, in geographical areas where GPS signal penetration is possible. It's also useful for asset management, logistics tracking, or as a safety measure to keep track of people in risky areas. As part of a smart city IoT ecosystem, it can track municipal resources, waste management vehicles, or even track and analyze traffic patterns.

**6. Limitations:**
Excessive motion can lead to more frequent transmissions, which drains the battery quicker. It is dependent on the availability of GPS and LoRaWAN signals, which could limit its effectiveness in some indoor, underground, or remote areas. The device is also not waterproof, which may restrict its usability in certain outdoor conditions.

In conclusion, the RAK - 2171 is a robust, power-efficient tracking solution for long-range applications. Its use of the LoRaWAN protocol and GPS tracking allows it to be a highly accurate and efficient tool for various tracking needs. As with all devices, its limitations should be taken into account during the planning stage of any implementation.
