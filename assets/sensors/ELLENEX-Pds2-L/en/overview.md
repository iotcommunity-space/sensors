# Technical Overview for ELLENEX - Pds2 L (Pressure Sensor)

## Overview
The ELLENEX Pds2 L is an advanced pressure sensor designed for seamless integration into IoT environments. Utilizing LoRaWAN communication technology, it provides real-time monitoring capabilities in various applications, especially in remote and low-power settings. The sensor is optimized for medium-range pressure measurement tasks and is adapted for wireless data transmission, enabling efficient energy usage and reliable operation across extended periods.

## Working Principles
The ELLENEX Pds2 L operates based on piezoresistive pressure sensing technology. This device measures pressure through deformation in a resistive element when pressure is applied, translating it into an electrical signal. This signal is then converted to digital data, compressing it for efficient transmission via LoRaWAN networks. The sensor's built-in microcontroller efficiently processes the raw data, ensuring accuracy and precision through appropriate calibration before transmission.

## Installation Guide
1. **Location Selection:**
   - Choose an appropriate installation site where environmental conditions correlate with sensor specifications. Avoid areas with extreme temperatures, vibration, or exposure to aggressive chemicals unless specified by the sensor's protective rating.

2. **Mounting:**
   - The sensor should be securely fixed in a position using the provided mounting accessories. Ensure that the inlet and pressure points are correctly aligned with the process fluid or gas to avoid inaccurate readings.

3. **Electrical Connections:**
   - Connect the sensor to its power source following ELLENEX guidelines. Typically, it requires low voltage power, often derived from battery packs suited to long-life operations.

4. **LoRaWAN Configuration:**
   - Program the device with the network authentication details, including Device EUI, Application EUI, and Application Key. Use the ELLENEX setup software to facilitate this process.
   - Test connectivity to ensure that the sensor is correctly joining the network before final installation.

5. **Calibration:**
   - Perform a baseline calibration using standard known pressures to verify the accuracy of the sensor before relying on its readings.

## LoRaWAN Details
- **Frequency Band:** Varies based on regional regulations, typically using 868 MHz in Europe and 915 MHz in North America.
- **Data Communication:** The Pds2 L supports a long-range, low-power wide-area network ideal for remote monitoring. It utilizes adaptive data rate settings to optimize transmission power and frequency.
- **Network Join Mode:** Over-the-Air Activation (OTAA) is recommended for secure network joining, leveraging dynamic session keys.

## Power Consumption
The ELLENEX Pds2 L is designed for low power consumption, powered by replaceable battery packs that can last up to several years, depending upon data transmission intervals and environmental conditions. The sensor remains in low-power sleep mode, waking periodically to transmit data, thus conserving significant energy.

## Use Cases
- **Water Resource Management:** Continuous monitoring of pressure in water distribution channels and boreholes.
- **Industrial Process Control:** Ensuring optimal pressures in automated production lines and alerting in case of deviations.
- **Agriculture:** Managing irrigation systems through precise pressure feedback, ensuring efficient water use.
- **Oil and Gas:** Monitoring pipeline pressures to detect leaks or blockages promptly.

## Limitations
- **Environmental Constraints:** While robust, the sensor should not be exposed to conditions beyond its rated temperature and pressure range.
- **Transmission Range:** LoRaWAN's effectiveness depends on the network's coverage; obstacles and long distances can affect the communication range.
- **Data Latency:** The transmission interval is set to conserve power, which may lead to delayed data reporting in fast-changing environments.
- **Battery Life Variability:** Frequent reporting or harsh environmental conditions can reduce battery duration, necessitating more frequent maintenance.

The ELLENEX Pds2 L offers reliable pressure monitoring with minimal power consumption, suitable for a wide array of IoT applications, constrained only by its environmental resilience and network coverage capabilities.
