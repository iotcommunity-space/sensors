# ABS-TELEMETRIA Cel Io - LoRaWAN IoT Sensor (ABS-TELEMETRIA)

## Technical Overview

The ABS-TELEMETRIA Cel Io is an advanced IoT sensor designed for diverse monitoring scenarios, leveraging LoRaWAN technology for long-range, low-power communication. This document will review the sensor's working principles, installation process, specific network details, power consumption, practical application use cases, and inherent limitations.

### Working Principles

The ABS-TELEMETRIA Cel Io operates based on a variety of built-in sensors that measure environmental variables such as temperature, humidity, pressure, light, and potential customized sensor inputs. The device encapsulates these measurements and sends the data via LoRaWAN, a spread-spectrum modulation technique derived from chirp spread spectrum (CSS) technology, allowing for communication at significantly lower power consumption rates.

### Installation Guide

1. **Site Preparation:**
   - Ensure the installation site is within the range of a LoRaWAN gateway.
   - Check for environmental conditions that do not exceed the sensorâ€™s operational limits.

2. **Mounting the Sensor:**
   - Place the sensor in a location that ensures optimal signal transmission (considering LoRa's sensitivity to interference and obstructions).
   - Secure the sensor using the mounting kit provided. Mounting should be stable to avoid any data discrepancies due to physical misalignments or vibrations.

3. **Network Integration:**
   - Power on the device after mounting to initiate the auto-join procedure for connecting to the nearest LoRaWAN gateway.
   - Configure network settings via the provided software interface, typically accessed through a desktop or mobile application.

4. **Testing:**
   - Test the sensor's transmission capabilities to ensure consistent data reporting to the network server.
   - Adjust placement or settings as necessary depending on the initial data quality and reception feedback.
