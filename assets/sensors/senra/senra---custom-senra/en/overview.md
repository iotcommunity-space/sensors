## SENRA - Custom Sensor (SENRA)

### Technical Overview

SENRA Custom Sensor (SENRA) is an innovative piece of technology designed to function in a wide spectrum of Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Using Low-power, Long-range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) protocol, SENRA is an ideal solution for mass deployment in contexts with a low data rate necessity but with the mandatory requirement of autonomy and extended range capabilities.

### Working Principles

SENRA works on the principle of capturing specific telemetry data and transmitting it over LoRaWAN. It employs sensing technologies (either directly integrated or add-on modules as per the use-case requirements) to aggregate data and then communicates it back to a central location for further data processing and analysis. This is achieved through the LoRaWAN's ability to offer low-power, long-range wireless connectivity with reliable data transmission and reception.

### Installation Guide

Installation of SENRA is relatively straightforward.

1. Position the sensor in the desired location. Ensure proximity to the LoRaWAN gateway to achieve optimal transmission and reception.
2. Power up the sensor, and it will transgress into operational mode. 
3. Configure the sensor's reporting frequency and data transmission parameters according to the use case requirements using the provided interface.
4. Complete the pairing process with the server or central location for data analysis.

### LoRaWAN Details

SENRA uses LoRaWAN, a media access control protocol deployed over long-range radio link. It allows for communication with IoT devices without the need for complex local installations, giving it a significant advantage in battery life, capacity, and cost. LoRaWAN operates in the sub-gigahertz frequency bands, and the specific frequency spectrum used by SENRA can be tailored during manufacturing, making it compatible with the regulations of all geographical regions.

### Power Consumption

One of the key features of the SENRA sensor is its low power consumption. The sensor adopts advanced power management techniques that allow it to operate in a low-power mode when not transmitting data. This allows the sensor to operate for several years on a single power source, such as a small battery pack or renewable power sources.

### Use Cases

Due to its flexibility, SENRA can be deployed in myriads of applications. These include:

- Environmental monitoring for data logging of various parameters like temperature, humidity, air quality.
- Utility metering for remote monitoring and reporting of water, gas, or electricity consumption.
- Smart agriculture for monitoring soil moisture levels and crop growth.
- Industrial IoT for tracking and monitoring of equipment in production plants.
- Smart cities applications including waste management, traffic monitoring, and parking occupancy.

### Limitations

SENRA's limitations are based mostly on the limitations of LoRaWAN technology, such as:

1. Data Rate: Low data rate makes it unsuitable for applications that require real-time, high data rate communication.
2. LoRaWAN Gateways: The requirement for LoRaWAN gateways within the sensor’s range for it to be operational.
3. Limited IP Connectivity: As SENRA relies on LoRaWAN protocol, it doesn’t offer native IP connectivity, which could be a limitation for use-cases needing IP connectivity. 

However, given its robust design, easy installation, extended range, and low power consumption, SENRA offers a promising sensor solution for a wide range of IoT applications.
