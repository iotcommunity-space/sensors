## **DIGITAL-MATTER - Matter Oyster Sigfox Overview**

Matter Oyster Sigfox is an advanced tracking device developed by DIGITAL-MATTER that exhibits a perfect blend of energy efficiency, reliability, and robust internal components. Its main function is to track and accumulate data in real-time for assets in transit. 

### **Working Principles**

Matter Oyster Sigfox uses Sigfox technology, which is a low power, wide-area networking (LPWAN) protocol. This device uses GPS (Global Positioning System) and GLONASS or Galileo (alternative satellite systems) to perform its primary tracking functions. Once the Oyster Sigfox receives the satellite signals, it translates the received data into a processed location. Afterward, it sends the information to the user through Sigfox infrastructure since it employs Sigfox's ultra-narrowband technology for communication.

### **Installation Guide**

To install Matter Oyster Sigfox, first, activate the device by removing the battery isolation tab. Mount the device on a target asset using screws, bolts, or cable ties, making sure to place the device with its 'UP' side facing the sky for maximum signal reception. For configuration and asset monitoring, you can make use of the proprietary Telematics Guru platform or other adjunct third-party platforms that support Sigfox.

### **LoRaWAN Details**

While the Matter Oyster Sigfox primarily employs Sigfox technology, it should be noted that it does not natively support LoRaWAN (Long-Range Wide-Area Network). The Sigfox technology is commonly mistaken to be the same with LoRaWAN since they are both LPWANs, but they differ, having distinctive functional and operational features. 

### **Power Consumption**

Matter Oyster Sigfox is characterized by low power consumption due to its battery powered design. Its power management is impeccable as it features 3 x AA Lithium batteries with up to 7 years longevity under daily updates. The device is engineered for energy efficiency, turning on its GPS module only when an update is required, hence saving the battery life.

### **Use Cases**

Matter Oyster Sigfox has a wide range of use. Primarily used in supply chain and logistics, it offers real-time tracking for assets, vehicles, and personnel. Therefore, businesses can monitor the movements of their assets, enhancing safety, ensuring timely deliveries, and preventing unauthorized use or theft. In the agriculture sector, it can be used to track farming equipment, inventory, and livestock.

### **Limitations**

While the Matter Oyster Sigfox is an advanced tracking device, it is not without its limitations. Its dependency on Sigfox infrastructure for communication means it can only function effectively in areas with good Sigfox coverage. Furthermore, since it operates over a range of -20°C to 60°C, operating it outside this range may affect its performance. Moreover, the fact that it does not support LoRaWAN may require users interested in a LoRaWAN solution to consider other devices. 

In conclusion, the Matter Oyster Sigfox is a comprehensive and efficient asset tracking device with a focus on energy efficiency and expansive coverage, making it a prime choice for businesses worldwide.
