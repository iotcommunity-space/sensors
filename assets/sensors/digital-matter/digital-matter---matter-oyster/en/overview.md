Technical Overview: DIGITAL-MATTER - Matter Oyster

**1. Working Principles**

The Digital Matter Oyster is a compact, rugged GPS tracking device that has been designed for tracking assets that may be exposed to harsh environments or external forces, such as containers, trailers, skip bins, and machinery. The Oyster contains an advanced GPS chip, enabling it to receive signals from a range of satellite systems including GPS, GALILEO, GLONASS, Beidou, and others. These signals are processed to provide accurate location data. Alongside this, Digital Matter Oyster incorporates LoRaWAN technology for efficient and reliable data transmission.

**2. Installation Guide**

The device necessitates minimal installation due to its rugged, self-contained nature. It can be attached using screws, tie-wraps, rivets, or industrial-strength adhesives. Be sure to place the device in a location with a clear view of the sky for optimal GPS reception.

**3. LoRaWAN Details**

LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) is a low power, long-range network protocol designed for IoT devices. The Oyster uses LoRaWAN technology for communication, allowing for efficient and reliable data transmission even over large distances. It supports adaptive data rate (ADR), which optimizes both the data rate and power for communication. 

**4. Power Consumption**

The device is powered by 3 AA Lithium Thionyl batteries, with design consideration optimizing both battery life and performance. Depending on the asset's movement and reporting frequency, the batteries can last up to 5 years, significantly reducing the need for maintenance.

**5. Use Cases**

The Digital Matter Oyster has a diverse range of applications, including but not limited to: 

- Supply Chain & logistics: Accurate monitoring and tracking of goods in transit, securing your supply chain.
- Asset Management: Monitor the location of vital equipment or assets, deterring theft and enabling swift recovery.
- Cold chain Monitoring: Maintain compliant conditions by monitoring and controlling the temperature of your perishable goods during transit.

**6. Limitations**

While the Oyster is a robust and versatile device, it does have some limitations. The GPS may not function optimally in areas with significant structural coverage, such as within buildings or underground, limiting its effective use in these environments. Furthermore, although LoRaWAN technology allows for long-range communication, it still relies on the existence of coverage. Areas outside the network coverage may experience data transmission issues.

In a nutshell, the Digital Matter Oyster is a reliable GPS tracking device that uses sophisticated technology to provide trusted asset management solutions to a variety of industries. However, its effectiveness is dependent on environmental factors such as GPS and network coverage.
