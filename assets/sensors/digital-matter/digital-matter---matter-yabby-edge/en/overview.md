1. **TECHNICAL OVERVIEW: DIGITAL-MATTER - YABBY EDGE**

The Yabby Edge Sensor by Digital Matter is an innovative, compact solution designed to enhance asset management and tracking, especially where high-accuracy GNSS is crucial. It utilizes the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data for precise position tracking, along with various other sensor data.

**2. WORKING PRINCIPLES**

The working principle of the Yabby Edge is based on its ability to collect and transmit data through its LoRaWAN technology. It utilizes a high-accuracy GNSS receiver to connect with GPS, Galileo, GLONASS, and BeiDou systems for comprehensive and accurate data on location tracking. It also possesses an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) for detecting movement in three axes (X, Y, Z).

**3. INSTALLATION GUIDE**

The Yabby Edge is easy to install. Due to its compact design, it can be attached to any asset using screws, cable ties, or adhesive. The sensor is housed in a rugged, robust, and waterproof enclosure that can withstand tough environmental conditions.

**4. LORAWAN DETAILS**

LoRaWAN (Low Range Wide Area Network) is a data communication protocol that allows long-range communication of small amounts of data, making it perfect for IoT applications such as the Yabby Edge. The sensor can transmit to any LoRaWAN v1.0.2 compatible network, which can include LoRa Alliance network or private network servers with customizable parameters including Adaptive Data Rate (ADR), transmit power, and repetition rates.

**5. POWER CONSUMPTION**

The Yabby Edge is powered by three AAA batteries, ensuring a long field life. Power consumption has been optimized with the Adaptive Tracking technology, which adjusts the rate of GPS position updates according to how much the device is moving. This enables extended battery life up to several years, depending on usage.

**6. USE CASES**

The Yabby Edge Sensor is versatile with multiple use cases:

- *Asset Tracking*: It is ideal for tracking the location of assets like vehicles, containers, trailers etc., both in outdoor and indoor locations.
- *Logistics and Supply Chain*: It can provide real-time tracking data for critical asset monitoring.
- *Agricultural Industry*: It can help in monitoring and tracking farm equipment and livestock.
- *Fleet Management*: It can help in managing fleet vehicles, giving real-time status of vehicles' locations.
  
**7. LIMITATIONS**

Despite its numerous benefits, there are certain limitations to the Yabby Edge:

- It requires LoRaWAN coverage to transmit data. Hence, it may not function properly in remote regions with limited or no LoRaWAN networks.
- The GNSS/GLONASS receiver may sometimes struggle to get a fix in environments where the view of the sky is blocked or partially blocked, such as indoors or in urban canyons.
- The battery life depends significantly on usage and frequency of data transmission.
- User must consider appropriate placement on assets for optimal GPS reception and LoRaWAN connectivity. 

Despite these limitations, the overall performance, efficiency, and utility of the Yabby Edge Sensor are commendable, making it a valuable tool for IoT applications in various industries.
