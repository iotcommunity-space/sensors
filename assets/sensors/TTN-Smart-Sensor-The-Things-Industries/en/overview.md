The TTN Smart Sensor utilizes the LoRaWAN protocol, offering robust connectivity with minimal power usage. It supports the latest LoRaWAN specifications, ensuring compatibility with existing infrastructure.

- **Frequency Bands**: Supports multiple bands (EU868, US915, AS923, etc.), configurable per region.
- **Data rate**: Adapts data rates automatically via Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) to optimize transmission.
- **Modulation**: Employs Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) for reliable transmission even in critical RF environments.
- **Security**: Uses two layers of encryption: network-layer and application-layer, providing end-to-end data security.

## Power Consumption

To maximize battery life, the TTN Smart Sensor operates on low power modes when not actively measuring or transmitting data:
- **Sleep Current**: Approximately 2 Î¼A.
- **Transmit Current**: Approximately 40 mA depending on the transmission power level and data rate.
- Designed to last up to 5 years on standard AA batteries at typical usage conditions.

## Use Cases

The versatile TTN Smart Sensor is ideal for a broad range of applications, including but not limited to:
- **Smart Agriculture**: Monitoring soil moisture, temperature, and humidity.
- **Building Management**: Environmental monitoring to optimize HVAC systems.
- **Industrial IoT**: Condition monitoring of machinery and industrial environments.
- **Logistics and Asset Tracking**: Tracking shipments and monitoring conditions during transportation.

## Limitations

While the TTN Smart Sensor offers a robust solution, there are certain limitations:
- **Line of Sight**: Depending on the environment, obstacles can reduce effective transmission range.
- **Bandwidth and Data Rate**: Limited by LoRaWAN protocol specifications, not suitable for high-rate data transfers.
