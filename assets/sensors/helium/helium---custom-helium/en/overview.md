# HELIUM - Custom Helium (HELIUM) Technical Documentation

## 1. Overview
The Custom Helium (HELIUM) sensor is a state-of-the-art, versatile, energy-efficient IoT device compatible with the Low Power, Wide Area Networking (LoRaWAN) protocol. The device leverages the capabilities of the Helium blockchain to provide secure, scalable, and robust network coverage for a wide range of IoT applications.

## 2. Working Principles
The HELIUM device operates by collecting environmental data through an array of built-in sensors. This data is then encoded and transmitted over the LoRaWAN network. With further integration of the Helium blockchain, the data transmissions are secure, transparent, and reliable

## 3. Installation Guide
Installation of the HELIUM sensor involves the following steps:

- First, connect the device to a power supply, and turn it on.
- Next, connect it to a gateway that can transmit and receive using LoRaWAN.
- Finally, configure the device settings through the Helium application on your smartphone or computer.

## 4. LoRaWAN Details
The HELIUM sensor uses LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network), a protocol specifically designed for wireless battery-operated 'things' in regional, national, or global networks. LoRaWAN ensures secure bi-directional communication, mobility, and localization services.

## 5. Power Consumption
The HELIUM sensor is known for its minimal power consumption characteristics. It operates on a battery life that is designed to last for years, making it suitable for continuous monitoring and data collection in various environments.

## 6. Use Cases
Numerous industries can benefit from the HELIUM sensor's capabilities:

- **Agriculture:** In precision agriculture, HELIUM sensors help monitor environmental characteristics to optimize crop growth.
- **Smart Cities:** Infrastructure monitoring, environmental parameter monitoring, trash level detection, and parking space detection are some of the use-cases in smart cities.
- **Logistics & Supply Chain:** Monitoring of temperature, humidity, and real-time tracking in warehousing and transportation enhances operational efficiency.
- **Environment Monitoring:** HELIUM can help track various environmental conditions including air quality, water quality, and radiation levels.

## 7. Limitations
As powerful as the HELIUM sensor is, it has a few limitations:

- The sensor's range of data collection is constrained by the LoRaWAN network coverage area.
- Data transmission speed is slower compared to traditional WiFi or Cellular data services due to the Low Power Wide Area Network design.
- The device requires a good setup of LoRaWAN gateways for effective operation.

## Conclusion
The HELIUM sensor combines the strengths of LoRaWAN and blockchain technology to deliver vast possibilities in the field of IoT. Despite a few limitations, its benefits greatly outshine challenges, making it a valuable asset for smart solutions across industries.
