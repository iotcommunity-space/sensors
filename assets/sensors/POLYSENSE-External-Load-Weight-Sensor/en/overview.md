## Technical Overview of POLYSENSE - External Load Weight Sensor

The POLYSENSE External Load Weight Sensor is a state-of-the-art IoT device designed to measure and communicate the weight or load applied to a designated area. This sensor is integrated with advanced wireless communication capabilities, specifically leveraging LoRaWAN technology for remote data transmission over extended distances. The sensor is ideal for applications in industries like logistics, agriculture, and smart building management, where monitoring load weight is crucial.

### Working Principles

The POLYSENSE External Load Weight Sensor operates based on strain gauge technology. The sensor contains a strain gauge bridge, which deforms when a load is applied. The deformation alters the electrical resistance of the gauge, producing a measurable change in voltage that is proportional to the weight applied. This analog signal is then converted into a digital signal by an internal microcontroller, which processes and formats the data for transmission.

### Installation Guide

1. **Site Selection and Preparation:**
   - Choose a flat, stable surface where the weight measurements are needed.
   - Ensure that the sensor is protected from environmental factors such as extreme temperatures and moisture unless it is rated for outdoor installation.

2. **Mounting the Sensor:**
   - Secure the sensor using appropriate bolts and brackets aligned with its built-in mounting points.
   - Ensure the sensor is level to prevent measurement inaccuracies.

3. **Electrical Connections:**
   - Connect the sensor to a power source. It typically operates on a low voltage DC supply (as specified in the manual).
   - Configure any necessary wiring for communication if not battery-powered.

4. **Calibration:**
   - Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for initial calibration. Usually involves zeroing the sensor and applying standard weights to ensure accurate readings.

5. **Network Configuration:**
   - Configure the sensor’s LoRaWAN settings using the provided PC or mobile configuration tool. Set parameters such as device address, network session key, and application session key.
   - Ensure the sensor successfully connects to a LoRaWAN gateway.

### LoRaWAN Details

The POLYSENSE External Load Weight Sensor supports LoRaWAN, a Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) protocol, enabling long-range communication and low power consumption. Key details include:

- **Frequency Bands:** Supports regional bands defined by LoRa Alliance, such as EU868, US915.
- **Transmission Power:** Typical output is between 14 dBm to 20 dBm depending on regional regulations.
- **Data Rate:** Adjustable data rate to balance range and data throughput, using the Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) feature.
- **Network Architecture:** Supports both public and private LoRaWAN networks, allowing flexibility in deployment.

### Power Consumption

The sensor is designed with energy efficiency in mind to extend operational life in remote applications. It supports:

- **Power Supply Options:** Battery-powered or external DC power.
- **Sleep Mode:** When no measuring or transmitting activity, the sensor enters a low power sleep mode to conserve energy.
- **Operational Life:** Depending on battery size and usage frequency, the sensor typically lasts from 2 to 5 years on a single battery set.

### Use Cases

1. **Industrial Weighing:**
   - Monitor material weights in manufacturing plants and automate inventory control.

2. **Logistics and Supply Chain:**
   - Track cargo weight in real-time to optimize loading and transportation processes.

3. **Agricultural Monitoring:**
   - Weigh produce; monitor the feed levels in silos and detect stock depletion remotely.

4. **Smart Buildings:**
   - Manage load distribution in construction projects or monitor structural health by tracking changes in load over time.

### Limitations

- **Environmental Constraints:** While robust, the sensor might require additional protection in extremely harsh environments beyond specified standards.
- **Range Limitations:** Although LoRaWAN provides extended coverage, range might be limited by physical obstructions (e.g., buildings, mountains) and interference conditions.
- **Weight Limits:** Calibration is critical as the sensor has a maximum weight threshold, beyond which accuracy can degrade or a risk of damage occurs.
