## UDEV-Pms100 IoT Sensor: Technical Overview

### Working Principles:

UDEV-Pms100 is an innovative IoT sensor designed to monitor particulate matter in the environment, by leveraging the latest developments in IoT and sensor technology. The UDEV-Pms100 works on the principle of scattering and has a Laser particle sensor at its core, which measures particulates of various diameter sizes including PM1.0, PM2.5, and PM10.

It uses the forward scattered light principle to ascertain the particle size. It illuminates the particles and then measures the scattered light in the forward direction. An algorithm takes this sensor data, combines it with other conditioning factors and atmospheric variables and converts it into high accuracy particulate matter readings.

### Installation Guide:

1. Unbox the UDEV-Pms100 sensor package carefully.
2. Attach the antenna on the dedicated antenna port.
3. Connect the UDEV-Pms100 sensor to your power source.
4. Use the UDEV-Pms100 sensor deployment guide to facilitate it's correct positioning and installation in your chosen location.
5. Follow the instructions provided with the UDEV-Pms100 sensor solution to connect it to your network.

### LoRaWAN Details:

The UDEV-Pms100 sensor uses LoRaWAN (Low Power, Long Range Wide Area Network) for wireless communication. LoRaWAN operates in the license-free band and can provide wide-area coverage with low power consumption. The LoRaWAN functionality enables the UDEV-Pms100 sensor to transmit the collected data to IoT Gateways that are potentially several kilometers away.

### Power Consumption:

The UDEV-Pms100 has been designed to be power efficient following the principles of IoT design. The power consumption while operating in measurement mode is roughly 100mA, and during standby mode, it drops down significantly to about 2µA. However, power consumption predominantly depends on the measurement frequency and LoRa transmission cycles.

### Use Cases:

1. **Air Quality Monitoring:** The UDEV-Pms100 can be used in urban locations for near real-time monitoring of the particulate matter in the air.
2. **Industrial Monitoring:** Industries at risk of particulate pollution can leverage UDEV-Pms100 to monitor and control emission levels.
3. **Indoor Air Quality Assessment:** Ensuring clean and healthy air indoors can be done by monitoring particulate matter using the UDEV-Pms100 sensor.
   
### Limitations:

1. **Limited to Particulate Measurement:** The UDEV-Pms100 sensor is dedicated to particulate matter sampling and can't be used to measure gas pollutants.
2. **Operational Efficiency vs. Power Consumption:** Higher measurement frequencies and LoRa transmission cycles can lead to increased power consumption.
3. **Line-of-sight:** Like all LoRaWAN devices, topographic and urban obstacles can degrade the range and performance of the UDEV-Pms100 sensor.
4. **Weather Conditions:** Extreme weather conditions may impact the sensor’s accuracy and overall functionality.

Overall, the UDEV-Pms100 is an efficient solution for monitoring particulate matter and it is crucial in creating a healthier environment by providing accurate, real-time data that can be used to address air pollution problems effectively.
