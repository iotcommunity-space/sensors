## Technical Overview of ELLENEX - Plm2 L

### Overview

The ELLENEX Plm2 L sensor is a robust and highly efficient device designed for accurate monitoring of gauge pressure in diverse environments. Utilizing advanced piezoresistive technology, it offers reliable data collection with minimal drift over time. This sensor is specifically tailored for integration with IoT networks using LoRaWAN protocols, ensuring wide-ranging and secure data transmission.

### Working Principles

The Plm2 L operates based on piezoresistive technology, where the pressure on a diaphragm is translated into an electrical signal. This sensor is equipped with a microelectromechanical system (MEMS) that detects pressure changes and converts them into voltage variations. The sensorâ€™s internal signal conditioning circuitry processes the signal, which is then transmitted via its LoRaWAN module over long distances with low power consumption.

### Installation Guide

1. **Site Selection**: 
   - Choose an installation site that provides stable, representative pressure readings, free from vibrations and excessive temperature variations.

2. **Mounting**: 
   - Securely mount the sensor using appropriate flanges or threads. Ensure it is oriented correctly according to installation guidelines to guarantee accurate measurements.

3. **Connection**:
   - Connect the sensor to the process system. Ensure that all connections are leak-proof.
   - Connect the power source as specified in the wiring instructions.

4. **Initial Configuration**:
   - Utilize the provided configuration software to set initial parameters such as network keys and transmission intervals.
   - Verify that the sensor is communicating with the network and sending accurate data.

5. **Calibration**:
   - Perform a zero-point calibration if required. Follow the calibration procedures detailed in the sensor manual.

### LoRaWAN Details

- **Frequency Bands**: Supports various global ISM bands (EU868, US915, AS923, etc.).
- **Class**: Operates as a Class A or Class C device, compatible with LoRaWAN infrastructure.
- **Data Rate (DR) Management**: Adaptive data rate (ADR) feature enabled for optimizing transmission range and battery life.
- **Network Security**: Utilizes built-in 128-bit AES encryption, ensuring secure data transmission.

### Power Consumption

The Plm2 L is designed for energy efficiency, consuming minimal power to extend operational lifespan. It operates on a replaceable lithium battery, optimized to last up to 10 years depending on transmission frequency and environmental factors. Sleep modes and low-power electronics further reduce consumption during inactive periods.

- **Agricultural Monitoring**: Tracking water pressure in irrigation systems to optimize water use and maintain equipment.
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Gauging air or water pressure in environmental research stations for data collection and analysis.
- **Smart Cities**: Integrating with city infrastructure to monitor water or gas supply systems, aiding in proactive maintenance and management.

### Limitations

- **Temperature Sensitivity**: Extreme temperatures outside the specified range may affect sensor accuracy.
- **Pressure Range**: Limited to specific pressure ranges; exceeding these could damage the sensor or reduce its lifespan.
- **Network Dependency**: Requires a functioning LoRaWAN network for data transmission, which can be hindered by obstacles or interference.

### Conclusion

The ELLENEX Plm2 L is a high-performance pressure monitoring solution ideal for integration into IoT ecosystems. With its efficient design, reliable LoRaWAN connectivity, and versatile application range, it offers excellent value for industries seeking precision and durability in their pressure monitoring systems. Users should however consider the environmental conditions and maintenance requirements to ensure optimal performance.
