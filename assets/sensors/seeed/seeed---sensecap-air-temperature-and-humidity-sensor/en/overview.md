SEEED - Sensecap Air Temperature And Humidity Sensor - Technical Overview

Working Principles:
The SEEED - Sensecap Air Temperature and Humidity Sensor operates on the principle of capacitance for detecting humidity changes and uses a thermistor for measuring temperature variances. Humidity sensors function through a humidity-sensitive capacitance, which changes its capacitance value depending on the moisture rates in the environment. The system provides data on relative humidity and temperatures based on these measurements, which it then communicates over the LoRaWAN network.

Installation Guide:
Installation of the Sensecap sensor is straightforward and user-friendly. First, mount the device in the chosen location, ensuring it's away from direct sunlight or rain exposure for accurate readings. Connect it to the power supply and ensure it gets an RG1.25-4 signal. Once powered, the device will automatically boot up, and the color LED indicator will display the current working status of the sensor.

LoRaWAN Details:
The SEEED - Sensecap Air Temperature and Humidity Sensor utilizes LoRaWAN class A protocol for device communication. It functions in multiple frequency bands including EU868, US915, AU915, AS923, KR920, and IN865, making it a versatile partner for various IoT applications. Over the air activation (OTAA) and Activation by Personalization (ABP) are supported for enhancing device security.

Power Consumption:
The sensor offers a built-in 19000mAh Li-SOCl2 battery that is non-rechargeable but guarantees longevity. In proper conditions, it ensures a life cycle of up to 10 years, courtesy of this low power consumption feature. The sleep mode further reduces the current consumption to 20uA making the device energy efficient. 

Use Cases:
The SEEED - Sensecap Air Temperature and Humidity Sensor has widespread applications in both indoor and outdoor environments. It's extensively used in agriculture for monitoring crop growth environments, greenhouses, and weather stations. In commercial spaces, it helps regulate HVAC systems, maintain storage conditions in warehouses, and monitor lab environments. Other applications include home automation, smart buildings, and environmental monitoring.

Limitations:
While the SEEED - Sensecap Sensor offers excellent performance, it does come with some limitations. The device is not suitable for extreme environments where temperatures may exceed 65℃ or fall below -40℃. Also, its performance can be affected if it comes into contact with condensing moisture or corrosive gases. The sensor is designed exclusively for wall-mounting and not fit for underground deployment. Lastly, the non-rechargeable batteries, although long-lasting, will require the entire device replacement once exhausted.
