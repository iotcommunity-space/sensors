### SEEED - Sensecap S2120 8 In 1 Weather Sensor: Technical Overview

#### Working Principles:
The Sensecap S2120 8 in 1 Weather Sensor is a multifunctional device that integrates meteorological sensing functions such as wind speed, wind direction, temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, and precipitation level. The sensor adopts advanced sensing technology to assess such weather conditions and it processes the data to provide precise, real-time information about weather conditions.

Featuring a built-in microprocessor, the device collects data from the sensing units (anemometer, rain gauge, barometer, and hygrometer), applies dedicated algorithms, and converts the gathered analog signals into digital data, suitable for further processing or transmission. 

#### Installation Guide:
Installing the Sensecap S2120 requires careful handling because of its sensitive components. 

1. First, locate an open outdoor area where the device will have the least interference for collecting data. 
2. Now to install, start by securely fixing the bracket at your chosen location. 
3. Attach the sensor to the bracket; make certain it is well-fastened to prevent any dislodging. 
4. After affixing the sensor, connect it to the LoRaWAN antenna and power cables. 
5. Finally, turn on the sensor, and verify that it is working by checking the data on your connected device or platform.

Remember, a significant point to consider during installation is the height and angle at which the sensor is fixed. The higher the sensor, the more accurate the data.

#### LoRaWAN Details:
The Sensecap S2120 uses LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network), a communication protocol for transmitting its data. Being a low power, long-range, and wide area network protocol, LoRaWAN makes it possible for the device to communicate efficiently with minimal power consumption. The device supports global LoRaWAN frequency bands and has a range of up to 2km-10km, depending upon the regional regulations and environment.

#### Power Consumption:
As an IoT device with focused design on energy efficiency, the power consumption of the Sensecap S2120 is remarkably low. It is powered by solar and wind energy, with an in-built battery managing the power supply effectively. This makes it an ideal option for remote, off-grid installations where continuous power availability can be a challenge.

#### Use Cases:
The Sensecap S2120 can be used for various purposes across different sectors. For agriculture, it can provide data to help farmers assess and predict optimal planting and harvesting conditions. In the renewable energy sector, it can monitor the weather conditions to evaluate the efficiency of wind and solar arrays. 

Furthermore, the sensor proves beneficial in weather-sensitive sporting events (marathons, sailing, etc.) as it can provide real-time weather insight. Also, in disaster management situations, it can help in early detection and prediction of adverse weather conditions.

#### Limitations:
Despite its advanced features, the Sensecap S2120 does have some limitations. Its data transmission is affected by physical obstacles and weather conditions that might alter the radio frequency. Furthermore, the device demands careful, professional installation for accurate data collection, and it requires regular maintenance to ensure optimal functionality. Lastly, the sensor's competencies are limited to the weather parameters it was designed to measure, making it unsuitable for sensing foreign environmental factors like air quality, soil moisture, etc.
