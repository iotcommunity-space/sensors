**SEEED - Sensecap Soil Moisture and Temperature Sensor Technical Documentation**

## Overview
The SEEED - Sensecap Soil Moisture and Temperature Sensor is a LoRaWAN-enabled device engineered to provide highly accurate measurement of soil moisture and temperature. By utilizing Sensirion SHT31 sensor, both environmental parameters are captured efficiently, in a digital format, ensuring maximum accuracy and sustainability.

## Working Principles
This sensor operates on the principle of capacitance to determine the soil’s moisture contents. Changes in the soil's moisture affects the capacitance which the sensor can detect accurately. For temperature measurement, the device takes advantage of the varying resistance properties in semiconductors.

## Installation Guide
Below are the installation steps:
1. Mount the sensor on the mounting bracket.
2. Insert the sensor probes into the soil where data is to be measured.
3. Connect the sensor to the LoRa gateway using the LoRaWAN protocol, ensuring that the sensor is within the gateway's range.
4. Configure the LoRaWAN network parameters such as frequency, spreading factor, and security keys to establish a secure connection.
5. Once connected, the sensor starts capturing data and sends it to the cloud server at regular intervals.

## LoRaWAN Details
The SEEED - Sensecap Soil Moisture and Temperature Sensor leverages the LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) protocol for communication. This is a low power, long-range networking protocol, ideal for IoT devices. The LoRaWAN stack encompasses both the PHY (Physical) and the MAC (Media Access Control) layer for seamless integration with IoT applications.

## Power Consumption
The sensor is well-known for its energy-efficiency, making it suitable for long-term use in remote locations. It requires a 3.6V ER18505 battery for operation and has a low standby power consumption of 15uA. Data transmission power consumption is a maximum of 140mA.

## Use Cases
The SEEED - Sensecap Soil Moisture and Temperature Sensor is fundamental across several sectors, most significantly in agricultural practices where it aids in precision irrigation, crop health monitoring and improving crop yield. It also finds its applications in environmental monitoring, research institutes, and even golf courses for turf management.

## Limitations 
Despite the numerous advantages, there are some limitations to consider. 
1. The accuracy of the sensor could be influenced by heavy soil compaction, and thus, meticulous installation is required.
2. The sensor operates in the LoRaWAN frequency range which may vary according to the geographical location of the user, and the user is responsible for ensuring compliance.
3. The data transmission range, though significant, is still confined to the LoRa gateway's range.
4. The outdoor use of the probe tips is limited to a temperature range from -20°C to 60°C.
5. The wireless signal strength may be affected by physical obstructions and the atmospheric conditions. 

By acknowledging these limitations, you can use the SEEED - Sensecap Soil Moisture and Temperature Sensor more effectively.
