### Technical Overview of BROWAN - Healthy Home Sensor Iaq

#### Introduction
The BROWAN Healthy Home Sensor IAQ is a comprehensive indoor air quality monitoring device designed to track environmental parameters and improve the quality of living or working spaces. It utilizes LoRaWAN technology for communication, making it ideal for integration into smart home systems and broader IoT ecosystems. This sensor provides real-time feedback on air quality, enabling timely interventions to maintain a healthy indoor environment.

#### Working Principles
The sensor operates by continuously measuring key air quality parameters, including temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide (CO2), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and particulate matter (PM2.5). Data from these parameters is collected via integrated sensors:

- **Temperature and Humidity Sensor:** Utilizes capacitive techniques for humidity and a thermistor for temperature to provide accurate readings.
- **CO2 Sensor:** Infrared (NDIR) technology measures CO2 concentration.
- **VOC Sensor:** Metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) sensors detect volatile organic compounds.
- **PM2.5 Sensor:** Utilizes laser-based scattering methods for high accuracy in particulate matter detection.

The data is processed and communicated over LoRaWAN, a low-power, wide-area network protocol designed for secure IoT communication.

#### Installation Guide
1. **Device Location:** Install the sensor in an area representative of the space's air quality. Avoid placing it near high humidity sources or direct sunlight.
   
2. **Mounting:** Use the provided mounting kit to securely attach the sensor to a wall or other flat surface at an optimal height, typically 1.5 to 2 meters above the floor.

3. **Powering On:** The sensor is battery-powered. Ensure the battery is inserted correctly. Some models may also offer external power options.

4. **Network Configuration:**
   - **LoRaWAN Activation:** Configure the device using Over-the-Air Activation (OTAA) by inputting the AppEUI and AppKey into your LoRaWAN network server.
   - **Data Rate and Channels:** Select appropriate data rates (DR) and channels as per local LoRaWAN regulations.

5. **Calibration:** Allow the sensor to stabilise for a few hours post installation for optimal performance, particularly for CO2 and VOC measurements.

#### LoRaWAN Details
- **Frequency Band:** Compatible with standard LoRaWAN frequency bands (e.g., EU868, US915).
- **Class:** Typically Class A for minimal power consumption.
- **Security:** Employs AES-128 encryption for secure device-to-server communication.
- **Data Rate and Range:** Supports adaptive data rate (ADR) to optimize for distance and power usage, ensuring effective communication over large areas.

#### Power Consumption
The device is engineered for low power consumption to support long-term operation. It primarily operates in sleep mode, waking at intervals to take measurements and transmit data. Average battery life can range from one to three years, depending on the reporting frequency and network conditions.

#### Use Cases
- **Residential Air Quality Monitoring:** Ideal for homeowners interested in maintaining healthier indoor air for residents, particularly in areas where outdoor pollution or seasonal allergens are a concern.
- **Workplace Air Management:** Useful in office settings to ensure compliance with occupational health standards and optimize HVAC operation based on real-time air quality data.
- **Public Building Environments:** Suitable for schools, libraries, and community centers to manage indoor air quality for large groups of people.

#### Limitations
- **Calibration Drift:** Sensors may require periodic recalibration to maintain precision, especially for CO2 and VOC measurements.
- **Environmental Constraints:** Extreme temperatures or humidity levels can affect the accuracy and longevity of the sensor.
- **Network Dependency:** Relies on the availability and quality of a LoRaWAN network, which may limit usage in remote or poorly connected areas.
- **Battery Life:** While energy-efficient, frequent data transmission settings can reduce battery life. Users must balance update frequency with power consumption needs.

In conclusion, the BROWAN Healthy Home Sensor IAQ is a versatile tool for monitoring indoor air quality, providing users with critical data to ensure healthy living conditions through smart integration into IoT networks.
