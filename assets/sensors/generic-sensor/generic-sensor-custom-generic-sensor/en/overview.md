# GENERIC-SENSOR: Custom Generic Sensor (GENERIC-SENSOR)

## Technical Overview

The GENERIC-SENSOR is a versatile and customizable sensor module designed primarily for IoT applications. It integrates seamlessly into a LoRaWAN network, offering efficient data communication over long ranges with minimal power usage. This document aims to provide a comprehensive technical overview, including its working principles, installation guide, LoRaWAN specifications, power consumption details, potential use cases, and known limitations.

### Working Principles

The GENERIC-SENSOR is built on a modular architecture, allowing users to customize the sensor modules based on specific requirements. It can be configured to measure environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, pressure, and more, depending on the connected sensor module.

- **Sensor Module**: The GENERIC-SENSOR supports a variety of interchangeable sensor modules (e.g., temperature, humidity, pressure, etc.).
- **Data Acquisition**: The selected sensor module captures data at predefined intervals.
- **Data Processing**: The onboard microcontroller processes the raw data. Optional pre-processing (e.g., filtering, averaging) can be configured.
- **Data Transmission**: Uses LoRaWAN protocol for data transmission to a central gateway, from where it can be sent to the cloud for processing or storage.

### Installation Guide

1. **Select Sensor Module**: Choose the appropriate sensor module for your application and attach it to the GENERIC-SENSOR unit.
   
2. **Power Source Connection**: Connect a suitable power source. The device supports both rechargeable batteries and solar panels.
   
3. **Network Configuration**: 
   - Register the device with your LoRaWAN network provider.
   - Configure device identifiers (DevEUI, AppEUI, AppKey) as provided by the network.
   
4. **Physical Mounting**: Install the sensor at the desired location. Ensure:
   - It's mounted securely to avoid physical damage.
   - The location is within the communication range of the nearest LoRaWAN gateway.
   
5. **Testing**: Conduct initial testing to confirm data is being transmitted correctly to the network.

### LoRaWAN Details

- **Frequency Band**: The GENERIC-SENSOR supports regional frequency bands compliant with LoRaWAN Codex, including EU868, US915, AS923, and others.
- **Data Rate (DR)**: It supports data rate adaptation (ADR) for optimal performance, considering network conditions.
- **Transmission Power**: Configurable transmission power, typically ranging from 2 dBm to 14 dBm.
- **Communication Range**: Up to 10 km in rural areas, with typical urban range around 2-3 km.
- **Security**: Utilizes AES-128 encryption for secure data transmission.

### Power Consumption

- **Sleep Mode**: <10 ÂµA when not actively transmitting or processing.
- **Active Mode**: Typically 10-30 mA during data acquisition and processing.
- **Transmit Mode**: Peaks up to 120 mA depending on transmission power setting.
- **Power Optimization**: Includes adaptive sleep cycles and data rate scaling features to reduce energy usage.

### Use Cases

- **Environmental Monitoring**: Suitable for tracking temperature, humidity, air quality, and other environmental parameters in agriculture, greenhouses, and smart city applications.
- **Industrial Monitoring**: Used for measuring equipment or infrastructure conditions, such as vibration, tilt, or pressure.
- **Smart Buildings**: Employed for monitoring HVAC systems, water usage, and occupancy detection.
- **Remote Equipment Monitoring**: Ideal for remote areas where maintenance visits are infeasible.

### Limitations

- **Range Limitations**: Although LoRaWAN offers extended range, interference and obstacles in dense urban environments may reduce effective transmission distance.
- **Bandwidth Constraints**: Limited uplink data rates, making it unsuitable for applications requiring real-time high-volume data transmission.
- **Environment Sensitivity**: Extreme temperatures or humidity may affect the accuracy of certain sensor modules if not adequately rated for those conditions.
- **Power Dependency**: While low power, extended data transmission frequency or incorrect configuration can result in faster battery depletion.

The GENERIC-SENSOR is designed to simplify the integration of IoT sensors into various environments, ensuring reliable data collection and transmission through robust LoRaWAN technology. However, users must evaluate their specific requirements and environment constraints when deploying these sensors to ensure optimal performance.
