#### Working Principles

The Contact Tracing Badge operates by periodically broadcasting and scanning for nearby devices. It uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to detect and record proximities to other badges, capturing essential data such as device IDs and contact duration. This data is then periodically sent to a central server via a LoRaWAN network for analysis and action.

1. **BLE Detection**: The badge constantly emits and listens for BLE signals to detect proximity to other badges.
2. **Data Collection**: Each detected interaction is logged with a timestamp, device ID, and duration.
3. **Data Transmission**: Utilizing LoRaWAN, the collected data is transmitted to a gateway, ensuring the information is processed within the greater network infrastructure for real-time monitoring and analysis.

#### Installation Guide

1. **Unboxing and Initial Setup**:
   - Carefully unbox the badge.
   - Ensure the badge is fully charged or connected to a charging source.

2. **Activation**:
   - Power on the device by pressing the designated button until LED indicators activate.
   - Use the companion application to configure the device; connect via BLE.

3. **Configuration**:
   - Assign a unique ID to each badge using the application's administration panel.
   - Set operation parameters such as contact logging intervals and reporting frequency.

4. **Deployment**:
   - Distribute the badges to intended users, ensuring each is correctly configured and operational.
   - For indoor use, set up LoRaWAN gateways at strategic points to ensure adequate network coverage.

#### LoRaWAN Details

- **Frequency Band**: Operates primarily in the ISM bands (such as 868 MHz in Europe or 915 MHz in the Americas).
- **Network Topology**: Supports star-of-stars topology, with devices communicating directly to gateways, which then forward the data to a central server.
- **Communication Range**: Typical urban coverage is several kilometers, which can extend further in rural areas.
- **Security**: Features AES encryption for secure data transmission.

#### Power Consumption

The Contact Tracing Badge is optimized for low power consumption, enabling prolonged use without frequent charging:

- **Battery Life**: Capable of operating for several months on a single charge, depending on usage conditions and transmission frequency.
- **Sleep Mode**: Utilizes an intelligent sleep mode when inactive to conserve energy.

#### Use Cases

1. **Corporate Offices**: Monitor interactions between employees to enhance contact tracing efforts without invading privacy.
2. **Manufacturing Plants**: Ensure adherence to social distancing norms and record close interactions among workers.
3. **Educational Institutions**: Assist in managing and tracking contacts among students and staff.
4. **Public Events**: Facilitate contact tracing for large gatherings to manage potential exposure risks efficiently.

#### Limitations

- **Indoor Range Limitations**: BLE detection range may be hindered by structural obstructions, potentially affecting the accuracy of proximity data.
- **Data Accuracy**: The system relies on users wearing the badge correctly; improper usage can lead to incorrect data capture.
- **Network Dependency**: Requires reliable LoRaWAN network coverage for real-time data transmission.
- **Privacy Concerns**: Despite secure data handling, user concerns about tracking may arise and should be managed with transparent communication.

The LANSITEC Contact Tracing Badge is a powerful tool in the IoT arsenal for modern health safety measures, offering robust features while considering operational intricacies and network dependencies.
