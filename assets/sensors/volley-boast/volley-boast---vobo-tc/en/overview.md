### Technical Overview for VOLLEY-BOAST - Vobo Tc (VOLLEY-BOAST)

#### Introduction
The VOLLEY-BOAST - Vobo Tc is an advanced Internet of Things (IoT) sensor designed to monitor and transmit data for environmental, agricultural, and industrial applications. It leverages LoRaWAN technology to provide long-range, low-power wireless communication, offering effective data management solutions across expansive, remote environments.

#### Working Principles
The Vobo Tc operates on the principle of environmental data collection and LoRaWAN communication. It integrates multiple sensors, including temperature, humidity, and pressure sensors, to capture precise environmental data. These sensors convert physical inputs into electrical signals, which are then processed by an onboard microcontroller. The processed data are transmitted to a central server through the LoRaWAN network, where they can be further analyzed and utilized for a variety of applications.

#### Installation Guide
1. **Site Selection**: Choose an optimal site with good exposure to the environmental parameter of interest and within the coverage area of a LoRaWAN gateway.
2. **Mounting**: Secure the device onto a mast or wall using the provided mounting brackets. Ensure that the sensor faces away from any direct interference (e.g., building shadows for temperature sensors).
3. **Orientation and Calibration**: Orient the sensor according to the manufacturer's instructions. If required, calibrate the device using standard reference tools to ensure accuracy.
4. **Power Connection**: Insert lithium batteries, or connect the device to a solar power source if supporting this option, ensuring correct polarity.
5. **Network Configuration**: Access the device settings through the manufacturer-provided application or interface to configure the LoRaWAN connection, including setting the necessary Network Key (NwkKey) and Application Key (AppKey).
6. **Testing**: Conduct a test transmission to confirm connectivity and data accuracy.

#### LoRaWAN Details
- **Frequency Bands**: Operates in available ISM bands (e.g., EU868, US915).
- **Data Rate**: Supports a range of 0.3 kbps to 50 kbps depending on the environmental and network conditions.
- **Range**: Capable of transmitting over distances up to 10 kilometers in rural settings and 2-5 kilometers in urban environments.
- **Network Capacity**: Supports thousands of devices per network, thanks to its spread-spectrum technology allowing concurrent data transmission.

#### Power Consumption
- **Sleep Mode**: The device utilizes a low-power sleep mode to conserve energy, consuming less than 10 microamps.
- **Active Mode**: During active sensor readings and transmissions, the power consumption is approximately 50-100 milliamps.
- **Battery Life**: With an average report frequency and regular monitoring, the device can last up to 5 years on a single set of lithium batteries.

#### Use Cases
- **Agriculture**: Monitoring microclimate conditions to optimize irrigation and crop management.
- **Environmental Management**: Recording long-term climate data for research or operational adjustments in nature reserves.
- **Industrial**: Tracking environmental conditions in large warehouses or logistics operations to maintain product quality.
- **Smart Cities**: Integrating with municipal systems to manage air quality assessments and urban planning requirements.

#### Limitations
- **Line of Sight Obstacles**: Performance may degrade with obstacles obstructing the line of sight, such as buildings or dense foliage.
- **Network Availability**: Limited by the availability of LoRaWAN infrastructure, especially in less developed or remote regions.
- **Signal Interference**: Possible interference from other devices operating within the same frequency band.
- **Data Volume**: Not suitable for high data rate applications due to LoRaWANâ€™s focus on transmission range over bandwidth.

The Vobo Tc VOLLEY-BOAST is thus a versatile and efficient solution for diverse environmental monitoring needs, blending precision with an extensive transmission capability through its deployment in the LoRaWAN network.
