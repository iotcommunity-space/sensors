## Technical Overview for GLOBALSAT ST-100

### Introduction
The GLOBALSAT ST-100 is an advanced LoRaWAN-enabled sensor device designed for various Internet of Things (IoT) applications. It is primarily used for efficient and reliable remote environmental monitoring and management. The device is equipped with multiple sensors that facilitate various forms of data collection, making it versatile for diverse use cases.

### Working Principles

The ST-100 operates based on low-power, long-range wireless communication principles using LoRaWAN technology. The device is equipped with integrated sensors that collect environmental data—such as temperature, humidity, and location—which is then transmitted to a LoRaWAN gateway. The gateway, in turn, sends the data to a network server where it can be accessed and analyzed.

Key components of the ST-100 include:

- **Sensors**: Depending on the model, it may include temperature, humidity, and GPS sensors.
- **LoRaWAN Transceiver**: For long-range, low-power communication.
- **Microcontroller Unit (MCU)**: Manages sensor data processing and communication protocols.
- **Battery**: Powers the device for extensive periods.
