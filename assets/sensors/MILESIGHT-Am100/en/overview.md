# MILESIGHT AM100 Technical Overview

## Introduction

The MILESIGHT AM100 is a compact and versatile indoor environment monitoring device designed for smart buildings and IoT applications. It is part of Milesight's series of LoRaWAN-based sensors that provide real-time data for enhanced building management and environmental monitoring.

## Working Principles

The MILESIGHT AM100 utilizes various built-in sensors to measure environmental parameters such as:

- Temperature
- Humidity
- Light levels
- CO2 concentration
- Motion (PIR sensor)
- TVOC (Total Volatile Organic Compounds) levels

These sensors collect data at configurable intervals and transmit it over a LoRaWAN network to a central server for analysis and action. The device operates on a low-power Wi-Fi connectivity protocol to ensure efficient data transmission with minimal power usage.

## Installation Guide

1. **Device Unpacking and Inspection:**
   - Carefully unpack the MILESIGHT AM100 device from its packaging.
   - Inspect the unit for any visible damage that may have occurred during shipping.

2. **Battery Installation:**
   - Open the deviceâ€™s battery compartment and insert the supplied batteries, ensuring the correct polarity.

3. **Device Configuration:**
   - Use the Milesight IoT Cloud service or associated LoRaWAN Network Server platform to configure the device settings.
   - Set parameters such as data transmission intervals, thresholds for alerts, and device identification.

4. **Mounting Location:**
   - Choose an appropriate indoor location for installation, keeping in mind the environmental factors you wish to monitor.
   - The device can be mounted on walls or placed on flat surfaces using the provided mounting accessories.

5. **Activate and Test:**
   - Power on the device and ensure it initiates communication with the LoRaWAN gateway.
   - Verify successful data transmission to your cloud platform through the device's dashboard or mobile application.

## LoRaWAN Details

- **Frequency Bands:** Supports multiple regional frequencies (EU868, US915, AS923, etc.)
- **Data Rate:** Adheres to LoRaWAN Class A and Class C communication standards.
- **Network Security:** Equipped with AES-128 encryption to secure data in transit.
- **Communication Range:** Typically offers up to 10 km in rural areas and 2 km in urban settings, contingent on the environment and network configuration.

## Power Consumption

The AM100 is designed to operate with minimal power requirements, extending battery life substantially. 

- **Battery Type:** Typically powered by standard AA or lithium batteries.
- **Life Expectancy:** Depending on data transmission intervals, battery life can exceed several years.
- **Sleep Mode:** Utilizes a low-power sleep mode when not actively taking measurements or transmitting data.

## Use Cases

1. **Smart Building Management:**
   - Monitor indoor environmental quality (IEQ) to optimize HVAC systems, reducing energy consumption.

2. **Health and Safety:**
   - Track CO2 and TVOC levels to ensure compliance with safety regulations and maintain healthy indoor air quality.

3. **Office Spaces:**
   - Automate lighting and climate control based on occupancy, improving energy efficiency and occupant comfort.

4. **Educational Institutions:**
   - Monitor classroom environments to optimize air quality for productivity and health.

## Limitations

Although the MILESIGHT AM100 is a powerful tool for environmental monitoring, it also has limitations:

- **Indoor Usage Only:** The device is not designed for outdoor conditions.
- **Battery Life Dependency:** Frequent data transmission or constant sensor activation can shorten battery life.
- **Coverage Limitations:** The effectiveness of LoRaWAN is subject to your location, network infrastructure, and potential physical obstructions.

The MILESIGHT AM100 sensor integrates multiple sensing technologies in a compact unit, optimizing indoor environment control and energy efficiency through the reliable LoRaWAN communication protocol.
