## Technical Overview: WATTECO - Intenso Sensor

### Introduction
The WATTECO Intenso Sensor is a sophisticated IoT device designed to measure electrical current and voltage parameters in various industrial and commercial settings. It operates using the LoRaWAN protocol, ensuring long-range wireless communication capabilities, which makes it ideal for remote monitoring applications.

### Working Principles

The Intenso Sensor utilizes non-intrusive clamp-on sensors to detect electrical parameters. It functions based on the Hall Effect principle, allowing it to measure AC and DC currents without breaking the circuit. The sensor captures instantaneous voltage and current measurements, computes real power, reactive power, and apparent power, and calculates energy consumption over time. The processed data is then transmitted over LoRaWAN for further analysis and monitoring.

### Installation Guide

1. **Site Assessment**: Evaluate the installation site for adequate LoRaWAN signal strength and ensure that the environment is safe for access to electrical panels.

2. **Mounting the Sensor**: 
   - Attach the current clamps around the electrical conductors to be monitored. Ensure the clamps are securely fit and properly positioned.
   - Connect the voltage probes to the respective voltage points, ensuring secure and safe connections. 

3. **Configuration**:
   - Power the device using its internal battery pack, or an external power supply, following the wiring instructions in the user manual.
   - Use a configuration tool or software provided by WATTECO to set up the device parameters, align time zones, and assign network settings.

4. **Network Integration**:
   - Register the sensor on a compatible LoRaWAN network server using the provided Device EUI, App EUI, and App Key.
   - Ensure data packets are being successfully received on the network server.

### LoRaWAN Details

- **Frequency Bands**: Compatible with multiple global frequency bands (such as EU868, US915, etc.) depending on regional requirements.
- **Data Rate**: Supports adaptive data rate (ADR) to optimize energy efficiency and range.
- **Security**: Uses AES-128 encrypted communication to ensure data integrity and confidentiality.
- **Range**: Typically up to 10-15 km in rural areas and 1-5 km in urban settings.

### Power Consumption

The Intenso Sensor operates with ultra-low power consumption due to its advanced power management system and optimized data transmission techniques. Its battery life can extend up to several years, depending on the reporting frequency and usage conditions. Battery status is periodically sent to the network to facilitate timely maintenance.

### Use Cases

- **Industrial Energy Management**: Monitor the electrical consumption of machinery to optimize energy utilization and prevent inefficiencies.
- **Commercial Building Automation**: Integrate with building management systems for real-time energy monitoring and resource allocation.
- **Grid Network Monitoring**: Aid in the surveillance of power grids, improving fault detection and load balancing.
- **Renewable Energy Monitoring**: Track energy production and consumption in solar or wind farms for better resource management.

### Limitations

- **Signal Interference**: Performance might be affected in environments with significant RF interference or large metal obstructions.
- **Accuracy**: Precision can vary based on calibration and installation accuracy. Regular recalibration may be necessary for high-accuracy applications.
- **Temperature Range**: Ensure usage within the specified operating temperature range to avoid inaccuracies or malfunctions.
- **Data Latency**: The low data rate means there can be a delay in data reporting, which may not be suitable for real-time critical applications.

In conclusion, the WATTECO Intenso Sensor is a versatile tool for electrical monitoring applications, offering robust LoRaWAN communication and efficient power usage. However, careful consideration of installation and environmental factors is crucial to maximize its benefits and ensure reliable performance.
