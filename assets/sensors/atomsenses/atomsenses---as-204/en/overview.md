# ATOMSENSES - As 204 (ATOMSENSES) - Technical Documentation 

## 1. Overview

ATOMSENSES - As 204, is an advanced, smart IoT sensor designed to capture and process diverse environmental data and transmit it over LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) for analysis and monitoring. The sensor captures critical environmental parameters like temperature, humidity, light intensity, among others. The core function of the ATOMSENSES- As 204 sensor is to facilitate real-time environmental monitoring and control.

## 2. Working Principles

ATOMSENSES - As 204 works on the principle of data gathering and transmission. Equipped with several built-in sensors, it captures various elementary environmental data. The captured data is then processed and packed into a LoRaWAN compatible format and transmitted over the network at regular intervals. The transmission cycle can be configured based on the user's needs. A strong low-power embedded circuit ensures a long, efficient operational life. 

## 3. Installation Guide

1. Unpack the sensor module from the packaging and handle it with proper ESD safety measures.
2. Position the ATOMSENSES - As 204 in the desired location. The location should have an adequate LoRa network coverage and be suitable for capturing the intended data adequately.
3. Power up the device using the power source. The device will initialize itself and start capturing the data from its environment.
4. Join the device to the LoRaWAN network by following the appropriate OTAA (Over The Air Activation) or ABP (Authorization By Personalization) joining procedures as required by your network operator.

## 4. LoRaWAN Details

ATOMSENSES - As 204 is compatible with the LoRaWAN protocol, a media access control (MAC) layer protocol for large-scale public networks with a single operator. It is designed to allow low-powered devices to communicate with Internet-connected applications over long range wireless connections.

ATOMSENSES - As 204 operates in the ISM band, which is license-free and is usually regulated by bodies like ETSI, FCC, etc. All module settings like data-rate, transmission power, frequencies, etc., are fully configurable over-The-Air.

## 5. Power Consumption

ATOMSENSES - As 204 is designed for low power consumption. The device's advanced sleep and wake cycle mechanism contribute to significantly reducing power use while idle. A considerable power reduction is achieved during its sleep cycle, while power to the necessary circuits only is provided during the wake cycle. This inherently extends the sensor device's battery life, making it ideal for remote or difficult-to-service locations.

## 6. Use Cases

ATOMSENSES - As 204 finds applications in a wide range of scenarios, these include but are not limited to:

- Environmental Monitoring: The sensor can be used to monitor climatic conditions in sensitive environments like botanical gardens, farms, and greenhouses.  
- Smart Cities: The sensor can help monitor and manage environmental conditions in urban areas.
- Industrial Monitoring: The device can help track and control various parameters in industrial areas, warehouses, and factories.

## 7. Limitations
Though ATOMSENSES - As 204 comes with several features, it does have some limitations.

- It requires a LoRa network coverage to operate; the absence of this can hinder its performance.
- The accuracy of certain sensors could be affected by extreme environmental conditions.
- The settings for the device operation require knowledge about LoRaWAN and related settings.
- Though it has lower power consumption, continuous high-frequency transmission without a proper power management strategy can reduce the device's lifetime.
