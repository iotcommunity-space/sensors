# Technical Overview of MILESIGHT EM500-PP (Pressure Sensor)

## Introduction

The MILESIGHT EM500-PP is a high-performance IoT sensor specifically designed to measure pressure in various environments. This sensor is part of the MILESIGHT EM500 series and is tailored for monitoring pressure levels in water systems, oil pipelines, and other industry-related applications through LoRaWAN technology. It aims to deliver accurate measurements while operating under harsh conditions.

## Working Principles

The EM500-PP sensor operates based on a piezoresistive pressure sensing technology. It contains a diaphragm that deforms under applied pressure. This deformation changes the electrical resistance of the sensor material, which is converted into a voltage signal and further processed to provide precise pressure readings. The sensor is equipped with advanced electronics that amplify and convert this data into a standard digital output format, which is then transmitted over the LoRaWAN network.

## Installation Guide

1. **Location Assessment**: Prior to installation, assess the location to ensure it is suitable. The sensor should be installed where it can directly measure the medium without obstruction.

2. **Mounting**: The EM500-PP is designed for easy mounting using flanges or threaded connections. Ensure the connection is secure to prevent leaks and potential sensor damage.

3. **Orientation**: Install the sensor vertically or perpendicularly to the flow for optimal performance, as improper orientation can lead to inaccurate measurements.

4. **Sealing**: Utilize appropriate sealing materials like Teflon tape for threaded connections to prevent any leakage.

5. **Electrical Connection**: Connect the sensor to a suitable power source, adhering to the voltage requirements specified in the datasheet. Ensure all connections are secure and insulated.

6. **Configuration**: Configure the sensor parameters such as measurement range and frequency using the provided USB connection and software tool before final deployment.
