# SENET - Custom Senet (SENET) Technical Overview

## Introduction
SENET is a specialized sensor developed for applications requiring robust, scalable, and low-power network solutions. Utilizing the LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) protocol, SENET is designed to efficiently transmit data over long distances, making it ideal for IoT applications that demand reliable connectivity even in remote locations.

## Working Principles

### LoRaWAN Technology
SENET operates using the LoRaWAN protocol, a low-power, wide-area networking (LPWAN) technology. LoRaWAN is optimized for long-range, low-power communication and provides secure, bi-directional data transfer.

- **Star Topology**: Devices communicate with gateways that are connected to a central server.
- **Adaptive Data Rates**: Dynamic data rates ensure optimization of battery life and network capacity.
- **Secure Communication**: End-to-end AES-128 encryption ensures data privacy and security.

### Data Transmission
- **Frequency Bands**: SENET modules operate on various ISM bands (e.g., EU868, US915, AS923), depending on regional regulations.
- **Transmit Power**: Adjustable power levels to balance range and power consumption.
- **Duty Cycle**: Complies with regulatory requirements to minimize RF interference.

## Installation Guide

### Necessary Components
- SENET Sensor Module
- LoRaWAN Gateway
- Appropriate power supply (battery or direct AC power)
- Mounting Hardware

### Step-by-Step Installation
1. **Pre-Installation Setup**:
   - Ensure the LoRaWAN gateway is properly configured and connected to the network.
   - Register the SENET device with the LoRaWAN Network Server using its unique DevEUI.

2. **Mounting the SENET Sensor**:
   - Choose a location with minimal obstructions for optimal signal transmission.
   - Utilize appropriate mounting tools to securely attach the sensor to its installation point.

3. **Power Connection**:
   - Connect the sensor to a power source. Ensure that battery connections are secure if using a battery pack.
   - Verify the power indicator LED to ensure the module is receiving power.

4. **Configuration**:
   - Use the dedicated configuration application to set network parameters.
   - Confirm proper operation through test transmissions to the gateway.

5. **Network Testing**:
   - Conduct range and connectivity tests to ensure reliable communication with the gateway.
   - Make any necessary adjustments to antenna positioning or power settings.

## LoRaWAN Details
- **Classes Supported**: SENET supports Class A (bi-directional communication at the least power constraint) and Class C (nodes have nearly continuous receiver capabilities for low latency).
- **Encryption**: Utilizes 128-bit AES encryption ensuring secure data transfer.
- **Packet Structure**: Data is transmitted in packets which include headers, payloads, and CRC checks for integrity verification.

## Power Consumption
- **Low Power Operation**: Designed for battery efficiency with sleep modes and configurable duty cycling.
- **Typical Consumption**: 
  - Sleep Mode: <1 ÂµA
  - Active Mode: up to 50 mA during transmission.
- **Battery Life**: Can operate for several years on a single battery pack, depending on configuration and data rates.

## Use Cases
- **Agricultural Monitoring**: Soil moisture, weather conditions, and livestock tracking.
- **Smart Cities**: Utility metering, waste management, and environmental sensing.
- **Industrial IoT**: Equipment monitoring, predictive maintenance, and inventory tracking.
- **Remote Monitoring**: Wildlife tracking, environmental conditions in remote regions.

## Limitations
- **Signal Interference**: May experience degradation in densely populated RF environments.
- **Data Rate**: Lower data rates compared to cellular or Wi-Fi technologies due to bandwidth constraints.
- **Infrastructure Dependency**: Requires existing LoRaWAN gateway infrastructure for operation.
- **Geographic Restrictions**: Operation on certain frequency bands may be restricted in some countries.

By understanding the capabilities and limitations of the SENET solution, users can effectively deploy these sensors in relevant applications, maximizing their operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness.
