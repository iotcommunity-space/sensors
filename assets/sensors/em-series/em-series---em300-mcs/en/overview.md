### Technical Overview for Em-Series - Em300-MCS

The Em300-MCS is a versatile IoT sensor designed to measure key environmental parameters, notably proximity, temperature, and humidity. Part of the Em-Series, it is tailored for use in smart building systems, agriculture, industrial automation, and environmental monitoring. Below is a detailed technical overview.

#### Working Principles

The Em300-MCS employs MEMS (Micro-Electromechanical Systems) technology to measure proximity, temperature, and humidity. The sensor's proximity detection relies on an infrared (IR) sensor, which can detect objects within a specified range. The temperature and humidity measurements are obtained using a highly accurate thermistor and a capacitive humidity sensor, respectively. This combination provides precise and reliable data necessary for various applications.
