# Technical Overview of Em400-Udl (Em-Series)

## Introduction
The Em400-Udl sensor from the Em-Series is an advanced IoT device specifically designed for ultra-low distance measurement applications. Utilizing LoRaWAN connectivity, it offers robust wireless communication capabilities suitable for wide-ranging infrastructural and urban applications. This document provides a comprehensive technical overview of its working principles, installation guidelines, LoRaWAN specifications, power consumption, potential use cases, and limitations.

## Working Principles

### Measurement Technology
The Em400-Udl sensor operates on ultrasonic distance measurement principles. It emits ultrasonic waves that reflect off a target surface, calculating the distance based on the time taken for the echo to return. This time-of-flight data is processed to determine precise distance measurements, making it ideal for short-range applications like liquid level measurement in tanks or proximity detection.

### Data Transmission
Data collected by the Em400-Udl is transmitted using LoRaWAN, a low power, wide area networking protocol designed to wireless battery-operated "things" in regional, national, or global networks.

## Installation Guide

### Pre-Installation Requirements
- **Location**: Ensure line-of-sight to the target measurement area to avoid obstructions.
- **Mounting Surface**: The device should be mounted on a stable, vibration-free surface, either horizontally or vertically as per measurement needs.

### Installation Steps
1. **Mounting the Sensor**: Secure the sensor using compatible screws and fixtures included in the installation kit. An adjustable bracket can be employed for fine-tuning sensor orientation.
2. **Power Connection**: Ensure the lithium-thionyl chloride battery is securely connected.
3. **Activation**: Hold the activation button for 5 seconds to initiate operational mode. The LED indicator should blink to confirm sensor activation.
4. **Testing**: Conduct a basic test by placing an object at a known distance and verify the distance reading to ensure proper functionality.
