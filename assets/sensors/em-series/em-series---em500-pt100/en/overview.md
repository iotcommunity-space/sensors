# Technical Overview of Em-Series - Em500-Pt100

## Introduction
The Em-Series Em500-Pt100 is a highly versatile sensor designed for precise temperature monitoring in diverse environmental conditions. It is part of the Em500 series, engineered to deliver accurate thermal readings for industrial and environmental applications. This sensor integrates a PT100 RTD (Resistance Temperature Detector) sensor with LoRaWAN communication for long-range and low-power data transmission.

## Working Principles

### PT100 Sensor
The PT100 sensor is a type of RTD, leveraging the principle that the electrical resistance of metals increases with temperature. Specifically, the PT100 is designed to provide a resistance of 100 ohms at 0Â°C. The resistance is measured and converted to temperature readings using a standardized temperature coefficient. This sensor is known for its precision, repeatability, and stability over a wide temperature range.

### LoRaWAN Communication
The Em500-Pt100 uses LoRaWAN, a Low Power Wide Area Network protocol, to transmit data. LoRaWAN enables long-range communication, ideal for remote monitoring without the need for direct line of sight. The sensor can transmit data over several kilometers (depending on environmental factors) to a centralized network server. This technology is optimized for low power consumption, allowing the Em500-Pt100 to maintain prolonged battery life even with frequent data transmission.

## Installation Guide

1. **Site Selection**: Choose a location where the sensor can accurately measure the intended environment without obstructions. For best results, avoid placing the sensor near heat-emitting devices unless those devices are the intended monitoring targets.

2. **Mounting**: The Em500-Pt100 can be mounted using brackets or attached securely to a surface with screws. Ensure that the PT100 probe is fully exposed to the environment for accurate readings.

3. **Connection**: Insert the PT100 probe into the desired environment. If mounting in a liquid or semi-liquid environment, ensure the probe is sealed correctly to prevent leaks.

4. **Powering**: Activate the sensor by ensuring the internal batteries are properly seated. Verify the power status through the onboard indicator lights or external display if available.

5. **Network Configuration**:
   - Configure the LoRaWAN communication settings either via a dedicated mobile app or by connecting the sensor to a PC.
   - Enter the Device EUI, Application EUI, and Application Key into the LoRaWAN Network Server to authorize the device.
   - Perform a connectivity test to ensure the sensor is communicating correctly with the LoRaWAN gateway.

## LoRaWAN Details

- **Frequency Bands**: The Em500-Pt100 supports multiple frequency bands, including EU868, US915, and AS923, among others. Ensure compliance with local regulations regarding frequency use.
- **Data Rate**: The sensor supports adaptive data rate (ADR) to optimize data transmission efficiency and battery life.
- **Security**: Utilizes AES-128 encryption algorithms to secure data transmitted over the network.

## Power Consumption

The Em500-Pt100 is designed for low power consumption, capable of operating for several years on battery power. Typical battery life ranges from 5 to 10 years, depending on the transmission frequency and environment. Power-saving features include sleep mode and periodic transmission scheduling, reducing energy use significantly.

## Use Cases

- **Industrial Applications**: Monitor and maintain optimal temperatures for equipment and processes.
- **Agriculture**: Assess and manage soil and environmental temperatures for crop health.
- **HVAC Systems**: Provide precise temperature data for monitoring and control.
- **Cold Chain Logistics**: Ensure that temperature-sensitive goods stay within specified ranges during transportation.
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Study and manage the impact of temperature fluctuations in various ecosystems.

## Limitations

- **Range Restrictions**: While LoRaWAN provides extensive reach, physical obstructions and extreme weather conditions can affect transmission range.
- **Temperature Range**: Although RTDs are precise, their effectiveness may diminish at extreme high or low temperature ranges outside their specified limits.
- **Network Dependency**: Requires a functioning LoRaWAN network and compatible gateway for data transmission, which may involve setup complexities in new locations.
- **Battery Life Variability**: Although designed for long life, battery duration is dependent on data transmission frequency and environmental conditions.

The Em500-Pt100 is a robust and reliable choice for applications requiring accurate temperature monitoring. When correctly installed and configured, it provides invaluable data for decision-making in various industrial and environmental contexts.
