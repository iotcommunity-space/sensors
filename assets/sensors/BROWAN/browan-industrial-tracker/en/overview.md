# Technical Overview: BROWAN - Industrial Tracker

## Introduction
The BROWAN Industrial Tracker is a versatile IoT device designed for asset tracking and management in industrial settings. It utilizes LoRaWAN technology to provide long-range, low-power communication, making it suitable for applications requiring reliable data transmission over large areas.

## Working Principles
The BROWAN Industrial Tracker operates by capturing GPS coordinates and other sensor data to monitor the location and status of assets. Data is transmitted via LoRaWAN, a low-power wide-area networking protocol, to a centralized server or cloud application. This facilitates real-time tracking and management of assets with minimal power usage.

### Key Components
- **GPS Module**: Determines the precise location of the asset.
- **LoRaWAN Module**: Sends data over long distances with minimal power.
- **Sensors**: Additional sensors may be built-in for monitoring environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, etc.
- **Microcontroller**: Manages data processing and controls the communication between modules.

## Installation Guide
1. **Unboxing and Inspection**: Ensure all components are intact and undamaged upon receipt.
2. **Charging**: Fully charge the device before initial deployment.
3. **SIM Card/Network Setup**: Configure the LoRaWAN settings as per your network server instructions. This may involve inputting DevEUI, AppEUI, and AppKey into the network server for device registration.
4. **Mounting**: Securely attach the device to the asset using the provided mounting options, ensuring the GPS receiver has a clear view of the sky for optimal signal reception.
5. **Activation**: Power on the device by pressing the designated power button or using other startup mechanisms, depending on the model instructions.
6. **Testing**: Perform a connectivity test to ensure data is correctly transmitted to the server.

## LoRaWAN Details
- **Frequency Bands**: Typically operates in ISM bands (e.g., EU868, US915), subject to regional regulations.
- **Data Rate**: Adapts dynamically using ADR (Adaptive Data Rate) to optimize performance.
- **Security**: Provides end-to-end encryption using AES-128 to ensure data integrity and confidentiality.
- **Network Server Integration**: Compatible with standard LoRaWAN network servers like The Things Network (TTN), ChirpStack, etc.

## Power Consumption
The BROWAN Industrial Tracker is designed for low-power operation, enabling prolonged deployments without frequent battery replacements or recharges. The device may enter a sleep mode when inactive to conserve energy further. Typical power consumption metrics are:
- **Active Mode**: Approximately 50-100 mA during data transmission.
- **Idle Mode**: Less than 10 mA.
- **Sleep Mode**: Substantially lower, often under 1 mA.

Battery life can vary depending on configuration, transmission frequency, and environmental factors.

## Use Cases
- **Asset Tracking**: Monitor the location of industrial equipment, vehicles, and containers.
- **Supply Chain Management**: Ensure real-time tracking of goods in transit, enhancing logistics efficiency.
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Collect geotagged environmental data if equipped with additional sensors.
- **Security**: Provide location-based alerts for unauthorized movement or theft.

## Limitations
- **GPS Signal Reliance**: Performance can be affected in indoor or obstructed environments where GPS signals are weak.
- **LoRaWAN Coverage**: Depends on the availability of LoRaWAN gateway infrastructure. Coverage may be limited in rural or less developed areas.
- **Data Transmission Latency**: LoRaWAN's duty cycle restrictions can cause delays in data transmission, which may not be suitable for time-critical applications.
- **Battery Longevity**: Frequent data transmissions or extreme environmental temperatures can reduce battery life.

In summary, the BROWAN Industrial Tracker offers a robust solution for industrial asset tracking with its reliable LoRaWAN communication and efficient power use. However, its effectiveness is contingent on appropriate field conditions and network infrastructure.
