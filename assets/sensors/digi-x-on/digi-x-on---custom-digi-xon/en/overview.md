### Technical Overview: DIGI-X-ON - Custom Digi Xon (DIGI-X-ON)

#### Working Principles
The DIGI-X-ON is an advanced IoT sensor designed for versatile applications, capable of collecting and transmitting environmental data such as temperature, humidity, and air quality. It operates on the LoRaWAN protocol, enabling long-range communication with minimal power consumption, perfect for both urban and rural deployments.

- **Sensors**: The device incorporates multiple sensors for measuring various environmental parameters, including a temperature sensor, a humidity sensor, and a volatile organic compound (VOC) sensor for air quality monitoring.
- **Data Processing**: Onboard microcontrollers process raw data and prepare it for transmission.
- **Communication Module**: Equipped with a LoRaWAN communication module, DIGI-X-ON can send data over distances up to 10 kilometers, depending on terrain and network conditions.

#### Installation Guide
1. **Placement**: Identify a strategic location for installation, considering optimal exposure to the environmental variables you intend to measure. Ensure adequate clearance from obstructions.
2. **Mounting**: Use the provided brackets to securely attach the device to a pole, wall, or any structural support that offers stability.
3. **Power Connection**: If you are using external power options, connect the power supply to the designated input port. For battery operation, insert the batteries into the compartment and ensure they are seated properly.
4. **Network Configuration**:
   - Access the sensor's configuration mode by connecting it to a computer via USB or Bluetooth.
   - Install and open the Digi-X Configuration Tool software.
   - Enter necessary LoRaWAN network credentials including DevEUI, AppEUI, and AppKey.
   - Set the data uplink interval and confirm the settings.
5. **Initialization**: After configuration, power on the device. The LED indicators will show the operational status; solid green indicates successful network join.

#### LoRaWAN Details
- **Frequency Bands**: Supports global bands, including 868 MHz (EU) and 915 MHz (US).
- **Data Rate**: Offers adaptive data rate management, optimizing performance and power usage based on network conditions.
- **Security**: LoRaWAN at its core employs AES-128 encryption to ensure data integrity and security during transmission.

#### Power Consumption
- **Normal Operation**: Approximately 0.1 W in data transmission mode.
- **Idle Mode**: Less than 10 mW in low-power sleep state.
- **Battery Life**: Typically extends up to 5 years with a standard lithium battery pack, depending on data transmission frequency and environmental conditions.

#### Use Cases
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Ideal for urban pollution tracking, greenhouse condition monitoring, and agricultural meteorology.
- **Smart Cities**: Used in smart city applications to gather data for air quality control and urban heat analysis.
- **Industrial Sites**: Monitoring conditions in factories where temperature or humidity levels could affect processes or machinery.

#### Limitations
- **Network Dependency**: Operability depends on the availability of a LoRaWAN network, which may be sparse in remote areas.
- **Environmental Sensitivity**: Extreme temperature fluctuations beyond the specified operational range can affect sensor accuracy.
- **Data Latency**: Due to the low bandwidth of LoRaWAN, real-time applications requiring immediate data may experience delays.

The DIGI-X-ON offers a robust solution for various IoT applications with its long-range capabilities and low power requirements. However, understanding its limitations and optimal installation conditions is crucial for maximizing the benefits of the device within its operational context.
