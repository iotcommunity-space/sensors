## Technical Overview of POLYSENSE - Wind Speed Sensor

### Working Principles

The POLYSENSE Wind Speed Sensor operates on the principle of anemometry, utilizing a mechanical design to measure wind speed. It typically consists of three or four hemispherical cups attached to horizontal arms, which are mounted on a vertical shaft. As the wind blows, it causes the cups to rotate around the shaft. The rotational speed is directly proportional to the wind speed, and the device translates these rotations into digital signals, which are processed to provide accurate wind speed measurements. The device is often equipped with magnetic or optical encoders to ensure precise rotational data acquisition.

### Installation Guide

1. **Site Selection**: Choose an elevated, open area free from obstructions such as trees, buildings, and other structural impediments that might affect wind flow.

2. **Mounting**: 
   - Use a sturdy mast or pole to mount the sensor at a height of 10 meters above ground level for standard measurements, unless specified differently by project requirements.
   - Secure the sensor using adjustable brackets and clamps to ensure stability.

3. **Orientation**:
   - Ensure that the sensor is mounted horizontally, parallel to the ground.
   - Align the sensor according to the manufacturer’s marked orientation to ensure accurate data.

4. **Wiring**:
   - Connect the sensor to the power source and data logger using waterproof cables.
   - Follow industrial standards to protect cables from environmental damage.

5. **Commissioning**:
   - Power on the device and ensure it connects correctly to data acquisition systems.
   - Perform a functionality test by comparing sensor readings to known wind speeds using a reference device if available.

### LoRaWAN Details

The POLYSENSE Wind Speed Sensor is integrated with LoRaWAN technology, enabling long-range, low-power wireless transmission of data. The device is equipped with a standard LoRaWAN module, which communicates in frequency bands suitable for your region (e.g., 868 MHz for EU, 915 MHz for US).

1. **Configuration**:
   - Set the Device EUI, Application EUI, and Application Key as per the network provider’s requirements.
   - Utilize OTAA (Over-The-Air Activation) for secure device registration to the network.

2. **Data Transmission**:
   - The sensor broadcasts data packets containing wind speed information at configurable intervals.
   - Supports advanced LoRaWAN features, such as Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) and confirmed message transmission to optimize network capacity and reliability.

3. **Network Management**:
   - Ensure devices are monitored through a LoRaWAN network server (e.g., The Things Network).
   - Regularly check for firmware updates and network changes to maintain data integrity and security.

### Power Consumption

The POLYSENSE Wind Speed Sensor is designed for low power consumption, making it ideal for remote and off-grid installations. It typically operates on a battery that can last several years depending on usage and transmission intervals. Options for solar panel integration are available to extend power autonomy.

- **Resting Power Draw**: Approximately 10-15 µW.
- **Active Data Transmission**: Peaks at around 100-150 mW.
- **Battery Life**: Ranges between 3-5 years under normal operation conditions.

### Use Cases

1. **Meteorological Stations**: Used in weather stations for monitoring wind speeds and patterns.
2. **Agriculture**: Assists in precision farming by providing data for wind-sensitive operations such as spraying.
3. **Renewable Energy**: Monitors wind speeds for optimizing the operation of wind turbines.
4. **Urban Planning**: Used for assessing wind flows in urban environments to aid building designs and city planning.

### Limitations

- **Mechanical Wear**: The moving parts are subject to wear and tear, and regular maintenance is necessary to ensure long-term accuracy.
- **Temperature Sensitivity**: Extreme temperatures can affect the performance, potentially requiring additional shielding or calibration.
- **Communication Range**: While LoRaWAN provides excellent range, physical obstructions and rural installations may require additional gateways or repeaters.
- **Calibration**: Requires periodic calibration to maintain measurement accuracy due to potential mechanical drift.

By following the installation guidelines and understanding the operational principles, the POLYSENSE Wind Speed Sensor can be a robust component in various environmental monitoring and planning applications.
