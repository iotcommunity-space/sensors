# Technical Overview of TTN Smart Sensor (Nexelec)

The TTN Smart Sensor by Nexelec is an advanced IoT sensor designed for versatile applications, offering wireless communication through LoRaWAN technology. It is optimized for monitoring environmental conditions and is widely used in smart building, agriculture, and industrial automation contexts.

## Working Principles

The TTN Smart Sensor operates by using integrated sensor modules to measure environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and air quality. These sensor modules convert physical atmospheric parameters into electronic signals. The central processing unit then digitizes these signals for data analysis and transmission via LoRaWAN. The sensor typically includes features such as:

- **Temperature Measurement:** Using a thermistor or RTD for precise temperature readings.
- **Humidity Sensing:** Employing capacitive humidity sensors for accurate relative humidity measurement.
- **Air Quality Monitoring:** Utilizing gas sensors that detect the presence of common pollutants like CO2 or VOCs.

The sensor employs digital electronics to process the raw data, calibrate it, and prepare it for wireless transmission.

## Installation Guide

1. **Site Evaluation:** Choose an optimal location free from obstructions and reflective surfaces that might affect accuracy.
2. **Mounting the Device:** Securely mount the sensor onto a stable surface, preferably at a height that corresponds to the area of interest. Use the mounting brackets provided.
3. **Powering On:** Ensure the device battery is charged or connect it to a power source if applicable. For models with replaceable batteries, confirm they are properly installed.
4. **Configuration:** Utilize the provided software or mobile application for initial configuration. Connect the sensor to a LoRaWAN network by inputting necessary credentials, such as Device EUI, App Key, and App EUI.
5. **Testing:** Conduct preliminary tests to verify operational status and data accuracy. Ensure the sensor correctly communicates with the LoRaWAN gateway.
