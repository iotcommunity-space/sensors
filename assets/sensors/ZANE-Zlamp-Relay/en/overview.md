Below is a detailed technical overview of the Zlamp Relay, covering its working principles, installation guide, LoRaWAN details, power consumption, use cases, and limitations.

## Working Principles

The Zlamp Relay functions by integrating a relay switch to control the connected electrical circuits. It utilizes LoRaWAN protocol for long-range, low-power communication, allowing users to control the relay and monitor its status remotely via a central management platform. The device is equipped with energy monitoring sensors that provide real-time data on power usage, enabling efficient energy management and fault detection.

### Key Components:
- **Microcontroller Unit (MCU):** The core of the relay, managing all operations and communication processes.
- **Relay Module:** An electrically operated switch used to control the connected load.
- **LoRaWAN Module:** Facilitates long-range communication between the relay and the central network.
- **Power Monitoring Sensor:** Captures real-time data on current, voltage, and energy consumption.

## Installation Guide

### Pre-Installation Checklist:
1. Verify that the relay is compatible with the electrical specifications of the load.
2. Ensure a LoRaWAN gateway is installed in the vicinity for communication.
3. Confirm that the necessary power supply is available.

### Installation Steps:
1. **Mounting the Device:** Secure the relay in a suitable location near the target circuit. Use appropriate mounting equipment, ensuring it's away from moisture and extreme temperatures.
2. **Wiring:**
   - Connect the input wires from the power source to the input terminals of the relay.
   - Connect the output terminals to the load.
   - Refer to the wiring diagram in the user manual for precise connections.
3. **Power Up:** Connect to the designated power supply to power the relay.
4. **Configuration:** Access the relay via the central management platform to configure network and operational parameters.
5. **Test Operation:** Validate installation by operating the relay remotely and checking sensor data.
