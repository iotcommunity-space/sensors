## Technical Overview of NETVOX - R718Ia2

### Overview
The NETVOX R718Ia2 is a wireless IoT device designed for industrial monitoring applications. It is equipped with two external 4-20 mA input interfaces, making it ideal for integrating with industrial sensors that output 4-20 mA signals. This device employs LoRaWAN for wireless communication, enabling long-range data transmission with low power consumption.

### Working Principles
The R718Ia2 operates by receiving analog signals from connected industrial sensors through its dual 4-20 mA inputs. It converts these analog signals into digital data, which is then transmitted over LoRaWAN networks. This conversion and transmission enable remote monitoring and data logging from various industrial sensors, enhancing operational efficiency and enabling predictive maintenance.
