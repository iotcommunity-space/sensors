Technical Overview

YUDASH - Https (YUDASH) acts as a versatile sensor monitoring system, well-suited for diverse Internet of Things (IoT) applications. YUDASH primarily functions on the principle of data collection through sensors, data processing, and transmission through a secure HTTPS protocol to ensure the integrity and privacy of data.

Working Principles:
YUDASH operates by collecting environmental data from associated sensors (such as temperature, moisture, pressure, etc.). This data is then processed through an onboard microcontroller unit (MCU) and transmitted through the Internet using HTTPS protocol. Https ensures the data is encrypted and secure, making YUDASH a reliable solution for sensitive data transmissions.

Installation Guide:
1. Prepare your IoT device by plugging each sensor into the designated ports on the YUDASH board.
2. Use the YUDASH software program to configure your device settings, such as network preferences and sensor settings.
3. Connect the device to the internet through Wi-Fi or Ethernet.
4. Install the programmed board and sensors to the target area. Ensure that the sensors are positioned correctly according to their usage.
5. Start the YUDASH system, the data collected from the sensors will now get transmitted to your server following the configured frequency.

LoRaWAN:
YUDASH does not support LoRaWAN as it primarily uses a Wi-Fi/Ethernet-based connection relying on HTTPS for secure data transmission. A third-party LoRaWan module could be connected, but it would require significant customization.

Power Consumption:
YUDASH is designed to be low on power consumption. With standard activity (collecting and transferring data every 10 seconds), it draws approximately 100-150 mA. However, it can be programmed to go into a sleep mode between transmissions, significantly reducing the power usage.

Use Cases:
YUDASH can be applied in a wide range of circumstances, such as home automation (environmental monitoring, security), industrial applications (machinery monitoring, preventive maintenance), agriculture (crop monitoring, livestock tracking), and healthcare (patient monitoring, equipment tracking).

Limitations:
1. Lack of LoRaWan support makes it inadequate for use cases requiring long-range, low-power communication.
2. Since data processing is done on an on-board MCU, very high computation tasks may not be suitable.
3. YUDASH needs a stable and reliable internet connection and may not function consistently in locations with limited or volatile internet services.
