## Technical Overview: TEKTELIC Cold Room Temperature Sensor

### Introduction

The TEKTELIC Cold Room Temperature Sensor is designed for efficient and reliable real-time monitoring of temperature conditions in environments where maintaining specific temperature ranges is crucial, such as cold storage rooms, refrigerated transport, and pharmaceutical storage. It leverages LoRaWAN technology to provide seamless long-range communication, even in remote or industrial locations.

### Working Principles

The TEKTELIC Cold Room Temperature Sensor operates on the principle of continuous environmental monitoring. It features a high-precision temperature sensor that continuously measures ambient temperature and transmits this data via LoRaWAN networks. The sensor is optimized for minimal power consumption and provides high accuracy, stability, and a wide operating temperature range, making it suitable for various cold room applications.

### Installation Guide

1. **Placement**: Install the sensor in a location within the cold room where the average temperature is most representative of the entire space. Avoid placing it near doors, vents, or other areas with significant airflow or temperature fluctuations.

2. **Mounting**: Use the provided mounting brackets or adhesive strips to securely attach the sensor to the wall or ceiling at a height that allows for optimal air circulation around the device.

3. **Activation**: Power the device by inserting the battery. Follow the LED indications to ensure the device is active. An initial setup may involve connecting to a gateway to ensure proper network connectivity.

4. **Network Configuration**: Use the manufacturerâ€™s software or configuration tool to join the sensor to your LoRaWAN network. Input necessary activation details such as the Device EUI, Application EUI, and App Key for OTAA (Over-the-Air Activation) or required credentials for ABP (Activation by Personalization).

5. **Testing**: Once installed and network-connected, perform a test transmission to ensure data is being received correctly by the backend server.

### LoRaWAN Details

- **Frequency Band**: Operates on standard LoRaWAN frequency bands, supporting EU868, US915, and other regional frequencies as applicable.
  
- **Communication**: Supports adaptive data rate (ADR) to optimize performance and battery life, with communication effective through multiple floors of buildings and around obstructions due to its strong penetration characteristics.

- **Data Transmission**: Transmits periodic temperature data with configurable intervals for appropriate monitoring frequency, typically ranging from a few minutes to several hours.

### Power Consumption

The sensor is designed for ultra-low power operation:

- **Power Source**: Typically powered by a replaceable or rechargeable lithium battery.
- **Battery Life**: Approximately 5-10 years based on 15-minute reporting intervals and proper usage conditions.
- **Power-Saving Mode**: Includes a deep sleep mode to further conserve battery when not actively sensing or communicating.

### Use Cases

1. **Cold Storage Monitoring**: Ensures food or pharmaceutical products are kept within specified temperature ranges, preventing spoilage or compliance issues.
   
2. **Refrigerated Transportation**: Monitors conditions within trucks or containers, providing alerts if temperatures exceed acceptable thresholds during transit.

3. **Data Centers**: Used to maintain optimal environmental conditions to prevent server overheating and equipment failure.

4. **Healthcare Facilities**: Ensures vaccines and medications are stored at correct temperatures.

### Limitations

- **Environmental Constraints**: Extreme conditions beyond specified operating temperatures might affect sensor accuracy.
  
- **LoRaWAN Network Dependency**: Requires robust network infrastructure for effective data transmission. In areas with weak signal penetration, additional gateways may be necessary.

- **Latency**: Like all LoRaWAN devices, there may be a slight delay in data transmission compared to real-time communication methods.

- **Battery Life Variation**: High transmission frequency or poor environmental conditions can reduce battery life beyond estimated averages.

Ensure to follow manufacturer guidelines and local regulations for optimal performance and compliance with installations, particularly in critical applications.
