## Technical Overview of TEKTELIC - Seal

The TEKTELIC Seal is a robust and versatile IoT sensor designed for diverse environmental monitoring applications. Leveraging LoRaWAN technology, the Seal offers long-range communication, low power consumption, and high reliability for a myriad of use cases, particularly in harsh environmental conditions.

### Working Principles

The TEKTELIC Seal operates using a suite of integrated sensors that gather data such as temperature, humidity, and ambient light levels. The device communicates this data over LoRaWAN networks to facilitate remote environmental monitoring. The sensor is capable of sustained performance in extreme environmental conditions due to its IP67-rated enclosure, which provides resistance to dust and water ingress.

Key components of the Seal include:
- **Temperature Sensor**: Measures ambient temperature with high accuracy.
- **Humidity Sensor**: Captures relative humidity levels for environmental assessments.
- **Ambient Light Sensor**: Monitors light levels, which is essential in applications like smart lighting or ecosystem monitoring.

### Installation Guide

1. **Site Preparation**: Determine the installation site based on required data parameters and network coverage. Ensure the site is within range of a LoRaWAN gateway.
2. **Device Mounting**: The Seal can be mounted using screws or adhesive mounts. Ensure the device is securely fastened and oriented in a way that optimizes sensor exposure and data accuracy. 
3. **Setup and Configuration**: Use the TEKTELIC configuration tool to set up the device. Configure network parameters such as DevEUI, AppEUI, and AppKey for proper LoRaWAN connectivity.
4. **Power Activation**: The device comes with a pre-installed battery. Activate the device by removing the battery tab. Ensure the device powers on by checking status indicators.
5. **Connectivity Verification**: Verify the device's connectivity with the LoRaWAN network by observing join requests and data messages on the network server.

### LoRaWAN Details

The Seal features Class A LoRaWAN connectivity, which allows for asynchronous communication with minimal latency. It operates over global ISM bands, including EU868, US915, and others, making it versatile for international deployments. The device supports adaptive data rate (ADR) to optimize power consumption and network capacity.

### Power Consumption

The TEKTELIC Seal is designed for ultra-low power consumption, enabling multi-year battery life. It uses a highly efficient power management system to ensure longevity:
- **Typical Standby Mode Consumption**: Microampere range, preserving battery when idle.
- **Active Mode Consumption**: Milliamps range, primarily during data transmission or sensor activations.
- **Battery Life**: Expected lifespan ranges from 5 to 10 years, depending on data transmission frequency and environmental conditions.

### Use Cases

The Sealâ€™s robust and reliable design lends itself to many applications:
- **Agriculture**: Monitoring environmental conditions for crop management.
- **Smart City**: Urban climate monitoring and public infrastructure management.
- **Industrial Monitoring**: Monitoring conditions in manufacturing plants or warehouses.
- **Environmental Research**: Data collection in remote or challenging terrains.

### Limitations

Despite its versatility, the TEKTELIC Seal has a few limitations:
- **Limited Sensor Suite**: Primarily focused on basic environmental parameters; advanced parameters or specialized sensing may require additional sensors.
- **Data Transmission Dependent on Network**: Effectiveness is dependent on the availability and proximity of LoRaWAN gateways.
- **Battery Replacements**: While the device boasts long battery life, certain high-frequency applications may necessitate more frequent battery replacements than average.

In summary, the TEKTELIC Seal is a solid choice for reliable environmental data acquisition in a variety of settings, though its efficacy depends significantly on application needs and network configurations.
