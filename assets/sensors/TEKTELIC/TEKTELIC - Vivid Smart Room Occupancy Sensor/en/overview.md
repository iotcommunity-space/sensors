## TEKTELIC - Vivid Smart Room Occupancy Sensor

### Technical Overview

The TEKTELIC Vivid Smart Room Occupancy Sensor is an advanced IoT device designed to monitor and report the occupancy status of indoor environments. Utilizing state-of-the-art technology, it provides accurate and real-time data to optimize space utilization, improve energy efficiency, and enhance user comfort.

### Working Principles

The Vivid Smart Room Occupancy Sensor operates primarily via Passive Infrared (PIR) technology, which detects the presence of humans by sensing the heat emitted from their bodies against the background. Complementarily, it incorporates ambient light sensors to enhance its capability in diverse lighting conditions. The integration of these sensors allows the device to accurately discern between vacant and occupied states.

### Installation Guide

1. **Placement**: For optimal performance, the sensor should be installed on the ceiling at a height recommended by the manufacturer, typically around 2.5 to 3 meters. It should cover the area where occupancy monitoring is required without obstructions such as furniture or large fixtures.

2. **Mounting**: Use the provided mounting hardware to securely fix the sensor. Align the sensor to the main area of interest to ensure a comprehensive detection range.

3. **Configuration**: Activate the sensor by installing the batteries, ensuring they are inserted correctly. Utilize the TEKTELIC provisioning tool to configure the LoRaWAN settings, set the desired thresholds, and calibrate the sensor according to specific environmental requirements.

4. **Testing**: Once installed, perform a walk test to validate that the device correctly identifies occupancy and transitions to idle states as expected.

### LoRaWAN Details

- **Frequency Band**: The device operates on the standard LoRaWAN frequency bands (such as EU868, US915) and should be configured according to local RF regulations.
- **Data Rate**: Adaptable data rates based on the ADR (Adaptive Data Rate) mechanism are supported to optimize battery life and signal quality.
- **Security**: Encrypted data transmission is ensured using the AES-128 encryption algorithm to secure all communications over the LoRaWAN network.
- **Range**: With a robust transmission range, the sensor can communicate several kilometers in unobstructed settings and several hundred meters in dense urban environments.

### Power Consumption

The TEKTELIC Vivid sensor is designed for ultra-low power consumption, leveraging energy-efficient components and protocols. It is powered by a long-life battery capable of sustaining operations for up to 10 years under typical usage scenarios. The sleep mode and duty cycling further optimize energy use, reducing unnecessary power expenditure when the sensor is not actively detecting changes.

### Use Cases

- **Smart Offices**: Enhance energy efficiency by integrating occupancy data with HVAC and lighting systems, ensuring resources are only utilized in occupied spaces.
- **Conference Rooms**: Monitor usage patterns to optimize room booking systems and avoid conflicts.
- **Hospitality Industry**: Automate room services and climate control based on real-time occupancy, providing a superior guest experience.
- **Retail Spaces**: Analyze customer movement patterns to improve layout designs and optimize staff deployment.

### Limitations

- **Environmental Conditions**: The performance of the PIR sensor can be affected by environmental conditions such as extreme temperatures and direct sunlight.
- **Detection Range**: While designed for ceiling installation, the sensor's coverage might be limited by high partitions or large obstacles.
- **Privacy Concerns**: As a non-camera-based sensor, privacy concerns are minimized; however, users must still ensure compliance with local privacy regulations.
- **Firmware Updates**: Remote firmware updates depend on LoRaWAN network capabilities and may require physical intervention if signal coverage is inadequate.

Overall, the TEKTELIC Vivid Smart Room Occupancy Sensor offers a sophisticated and reliable solution for occupancy monitoring, ensuring enhanced building management and energy efficiency. By providing real-time, actionable insights, it supports a wide range of applications, contributing to smarter, more sustainable environments.
