## Technical Overview for TEKTELIC Asset Tracker

### Introduction
The TEKTELIC Asset Tracker is a robust, highly effective solution designed for real-time monitoring and management of assets across various environments using LoRaWAN technology. It features a compact design with advanced sensors to track location, movement, and environmental conditions, facilitating efficient asset management and tracking.

### Working Principles
The TEKTELIC Asset Tracker operates using a combination of satellite positioning systems (such as GPS) and LoRaWAN technology. It continuously monitors the asset's location and other relevant parameters such as temperature, motion, and orientation. Data collected by the sensors is transmitted to a LoRaWAN gateway and then relayed to a network server. This data can be processed and analyzed in centralized application platforms to provide insights into asset utilization and condition.

### LoRaWAN Details
- **Frequency Bands:** Supports standard global frequency bands such as EU868, US915, AS923, among others.
- **Class Type:** Typically operates in Class A (default) and can be configured for other modes assuming network support.
- **Data Rate:** Utilizes Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) to optimize the message rate and battery life.
- **Range:** Provides extensive coverage potential, ideally up to 15 km in rural areas and several kilometers in urban environments.

### Installation Guide
1. **Unboxing and Inspection:** Ensure all components are included and undamaged.
2. **Power Activation:** Load the unit with its compatible battery pack or ensure the pre-installed battery is activated.
3. **Configuration:**
   - Using the TEKTELIC provisioning app or the Web UI, configure network settings including Device EUI, Application Key, and JoinEUI.
   - Ensure proper GPS fix by place placement in open areas initially.
4. **Attachment to Asset:** Secure the tracker to the asset using the provided mounts or straps. It's advisable to position the tracker where it can maintain GPS connectivity and is not obstructed.
5. **Testing and Network Join:** Verify successful network join through test signals transmitted to the network server before deploying for full-fledged use.

### Power Consumption
The tracker is designed for low-power operation, a critical feature for long-term deployment. When operating under optimal conditions (infrequent messaging, strong network connection), the device can last several years on a single battery set. Factors that may affect consumption include:
- **Transmission frequency:** More frequent messages increase power use.
- **Environmental factors:** Poor GPS signal may increase power as it attempts constant fixes.
- **Temperature Extremes:** Can affect battery performance and overall power consumption.

### Use Cases
- **Logistics and Supply Chain Management:** Monitor and manage shipments, ensuring efficient tracking and delivery.
- **Construction Equipment Tracking:** Monitor heavy machinery usage and movement across large sites.
- **Agriculture:** Track large assets like combines or soil monitoring units for better resource management.
- **Warehouse Inventory:** Support in tracking locations and movements of important materials within large facilities.

### Limitations
- **Coverage Limitation:** Requires a functional LoRaWAN network; remote areas might experience reduced connectivity.
- **Location Accuracy:** GPS accuracy can be affected by urban canyons, dense foliage, or underground placement.
- **Environmental Durability:** The device's effectiveness can be compromised under extreme environmental conditions, although the device is designed to some resilience against dust and moisture.
- **Data Latency:** LoRaWAN's inherent uplink communication delay might not suit applications requiring real-time data.

The TEKTELIC Asset Tracker, with its integration of LoRaWAN for efficient data communication and GPS for precise location tracking, is an invaluable tool for a myriad of asset management scenarios. While it offers many advantages, understanding its limitations ensures optimal application and performance.
