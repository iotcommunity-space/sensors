## Technical Overview: TEKTELIC - Flux Smart AC Outlet (TEKTELIC)

### Introduction
The TEKTELIC Flux Smart AC Outlet is an advanced IoT device designed to transform traditional power outlets into intelligent, connected endpoints within a broader IoT network. Using LoRaWAN technology, the Flux Smart AC Outlet enables efficient remote monitoring and control of electrical devices, contributing to smarter energy management and automation in various settings.

### Working Principles
The Flux Smart AC Outlet functions by integrating power measurement components and wireless connectivity into a standard power outlet form factor. It operates on the following principles:

1. **Power Measurement**: The device contains embedded sensors that measure electrical parameters such as voltage, current, power factor, and energy consumption in real time. This data is crucial for monitoring the efficiency and usage patterns of connected appliances.

2. **Wireless Communication via LoRaWAN**: The outlet utilizes Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) protocol for data transmission. LoRaWAN is favored for its low power consumption, extended range, and robust performance in diverse environments, enabling long-distance communication between the outlet and central management systems.

3. **Control Functionality**: Users can operate the outlet remotely to turn devices on or off, schedule operations, and establish automation routines based on data received. This is achieved through a central platform dashboard connected to the IoT network.

### Installation Guide
1. **Site Survey**: Ensure the installation site is within the coverage range of a LoRaWAN gateway. The outlet should be positioned where it can easily communicate with the gateway without obstacles hindering the signal.

2. **Physical Installation**: 
   - Switch off the main electrical supply.
   - Replace the existing outlet with the Flux Smart AC Outlet by wiring it to the power supply and securing it within the outlet box, following the provided wiring diagram.
   - Ensure all connections are secure and adhere to local electrical codes.

3. **Network Configuration**: 
   - Register the device on the LoRaWAN network server by entering the device's unique identifiers (Device EUI, App EUI).
   - Assign appropriate configurations and parameters, such as data transmission intervals and thresholds.

4. **Testing and Activation**: 
   - Restore the electrical supply and confirm the device is receiving power.
   - Use the associated mobile app or platform to verify connectivity and functionality, including real-time data collection and remote control capabilities.

### LoRaWAN Details
- **Frequency Bands**: The TEKTELIC Flux Smart AC Outlet operates across multiple regional frequency bands, which must comply with local regulatory requirements (e.g., EU868, US915).
- **Security**: The outlet supports LoRaWAN 1.0.3 security standards, including end-to-end encryption (AES-128) and mutual device-network authentication.
- **Data Rate and Payload**: Optimal configurations can be adapted to balance between data rate, message payload size, and battery life, depending on the application's demands.

### Power Consumption
Designed for efficiency, the Flux Smart AC Outlet maintains minimal power usage when in idle state due to its low-power LoRaWAN communication. The active power consumption is linked to the outlet's real-time sensing, processing functions, and energy delivery to connected appliances. Overall consumption figures are device-specific and calculated in aggregate with connected devices.

### Use Cases
- **Residential Energy Management**: Smart homes can utilize the outlet for managing appliance usage, reducing standby power consumption, and automated power scheduling.
- **Industrial and Commercial Monitoring**: The device is ideal for monitoring power usage in offices and factories, enabling predictive maintenance and optimization of energy costs.
- **Smart Cities**: It facilitates remote monitoring of public infrastructure like streetlights and municipal facilities.

### Limitations
- **Signal Obstruction**: Physical obstacles or heavy interference environments can impact LoRaWAN signal range and quality, possibly necessitating additional gateways.
- **Limited Bandwidth**: LoRaWAN is optimal for applications that don't require high-bandwidth data transmission, such as streaming audio or video.
- **Integration Dependencies**: Full functionality may require alignment with specific platforms or third-party integrations, which could necessitate additional setup time and complexity.

The TEKTELIC Flux Smart AC Outlet is an innovative component of energy-efficient, connected ecosystems. By integrating advanced monitoring and control capabilities, it enhances the flexibility and intelligence of power management systems across various domains.
