# TEKTELIC Orca Industrial GPS Tracker - Technical Overview

## Overview

The TEKTELIC Orca Industrial GPS Tracker is an advanced IoT device designed to provide comprehensive asset tracking in industrial environments. It leverages the power of LoRaWAN technology to deliver real-time location data and other telemetry information over long distances with low power consumption. The tracker is robust, weather-resistant, and engineered for easy deployment in a variety of industrial settings.

## Working Principles

The TEKTELIC Orca GPS Tracker operates using a combination of GPS and LoRaWAN technologies. 

- **GPS Module**: The GPS module acquires the global positioning data by communicating with satellites. This module computes the device's current location, velocity, and time, and sends this data to the main processing unit.

- **LoRaWAN Connectivity**: The tracker uses LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) protocol to transmit the acquired GPS data to a central server or cloud platform. The signal range can extend up to several kilometers, depending on the environmental conditions and network configuration.

- **Sensor Suite**: In addition to GPS, the device integrates other sensors such as accelerometers, temperature, and humidity sensors, which aid in gathering additional data pertinent to asset condition and environment.

The tracker periodically transmits data, allowing users to monitor assets in real-time and perform analytics for operational insights.

## Installation Guide

### Step 1: Activate the Device
- Ensure the device is fully charged or connected to its power source.
- Activate the device by using the on/off button or magnetic activation, based on the device’s specific model instructions.

### Step 2: Configure Network Settings
- Access the configuration interface through a USB connection or OTA (Over-The-Air) interface.
- Input the necessary LoRaWAN credentials (Device EUI, App EUI, and App Key) to join the LoRaWAN network.

### Step 3: Mount the Device
- Choose an installation location with a clear view of the sky for optimal GPS reception.
- Secure the tracker using industrial-grade adhesives or screws on the desired asset. Ensure it is mounted firmly to avoid displacement during operation.

### Step 4: Verify Connectivity
- Verify the device is successfully communicating with the LoRaWAN network using network server logs.
- Ensure GPS reception is adequate by checking location data accuracy.

## LoRaWAN Details

- **Frequency Bands**: Operates on standard ISM bands—generally around 868 MHz (EU) or 915 MHz (US).
- **Data Rate**: Utilizes adaptive data rates (ADR) to optimize communication, ensuring reliability and efficient use of network resources.
- **Network Server Integration**: The tracker is compatible with various network servers, including TEKTELIC’s own IoT platforms, The Things Network (TTN), and private LoRaWAN networks.

## Power Consumption

The TEKTELIC Orca GPS Tracker is designed for low power operation, optimized to extend battery life:

- **Battery Life**: Typically exceeds several years, based on reporting frequency and operational conditions.
- **Power Modes**: Supports multiple power-saving modes including sleep, standby, and active modes, which significantly reduce power usage during inactive periods.

## Use Cases

- **Asset Tracking**: Ideal for monitoring high-value equipment in sectors like construction, logistics, and agriculture.
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Collects environmental data, useful for applications in remote environmental studies and compliance monitoring.
- **Fleet Management**: Effective in tracking vehicles and ensuring efficient logistics operations, improving operational logistics through accurate real-time data.

## Limitations

- **Signal Obstruction**: Effectiveness can be reduced if installed in positions with poor visibility to the sky or in environments with significant physical obstructions, affecting satellite and LoRaWAN communication.
- **Data Latency**: Depending on network configuration and reporting intervals, there can be delays in receiving GPS data.
- **Battery Replacement/Recharge**: While designed for long battery life, eventual battery depletion will necessitate either recharging or replacement, which may incur downtime.

In summary, the TEKTELIC Orca Industrial GPS Tracker balances advanced GPS technology with robust communication via LoRaWAN and energy efficiency to provide a reliable and effective solution for industrial asset tracking applications.
