### Technical Overview for KHOMP - Its N02Q

#### Introduction
The KHOMP Its N02Q is a sophisticated IoT sensor designed for air quality monitoring, leveraging the advanced capabilities of LoRaWAN technology. It effectively measures various air pollutants, providing real-time data to enhance environmental monitoring and control.

#### Working Principles
The Its N02Q sensor utilizes a combination of electrochemical sensors to detect nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels in the air. As air passes through the device, the electrochemical sensors trigger a chemical reaction that generates an electrical current proportional to the concentration of the detected gas. This current is then processed and translated into a readable NO2 value. The device is equipped with a microcontroller to process sensor data and transmit it wirelessly via the LoRaWAN network.
