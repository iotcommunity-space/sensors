# Technical Overview of KHOMP ITG200 LoRa Connector

## Introduction
The KHOMP ITG200 LoRa Connector is a versatile Internet of Things (IoT) device designed to facilitate seamless integration with LoRaWAN networks. It serves as a bridge between various sensor endpoints and a LoRaWAN infrastructure, empowering users to monitor and manage field data in real-time efficiently. This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the connector's working principles, installation guidelines, LoRaWAN specifications, power consumption metrics, potential use cases, and limitations.

## Working Principles

The ITG200 operates by leveraging the LoRa (Long Range) modulation technique to communicate with LoRaWAN networks. It connects multiple sensor nodes deployed over a wide area, transmitting data from these sensors to a central LoRaWAN gateway. The device operates on sub-gigahertz frequency bands, optimizing both range and power consumption. Once data is sent to the gateway, it is forwarded to a LoRaWAN network server, where it can be integrated into various applications for analysis and management.
