## Technical Overview: Custom Sigfox (SIGFOX)

### Working Principles

Sigfox is a Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) technology designed for IoT systems that require simple, low-cost, low-energy consumption devices for basic data transmission. It operates primarily on the sub-GHz ISM radio bands and utilizes an ultra-narrowband modulation technique to enable long-range communication, with ranges typically extending from 3 km in urban areas to 50 km in rural settings. Sigfox transmits small data packets up to 12 bytes per message, up to 140 messages per day per device, making it suitable for applications requiring periodic status updates or alerts.

### Installation Guide

1. **Device Selection**: Choose Sigfox-compatible devices that meet specific application requirements. Ensure the device supports the necessary frequency band for your region.

2. **Registration and Subscription**: Register your device with a Sigfox network provider and subscribe to a service plan that suits your data needs and geographical coverage.

3. **Network Configuration**: Configure the device to communicate with Sigfox base stations. This often involves setting up the device ID and PAC code, which are typically pre-assigned and provided by the manufacturer.

4. **Antenna Installation**: Position the device's antenna to ensure unobstructed communication. Elevate the antenna if possible to enhance signal strength and range.

5. **Power Supply**: Connect the device to a suitable power source. Consider using energy-efficient configurations, especially if relying on battery power.

6. **Testing and Validation**: Conduct thorough testing to ensure successful transmission of data. Validate that the device properly connects to the Sigfox network and that data packets are reliably sent and received.

### LoRaWAN Details

It is important to note that Sigfox and LoRaWAN are two distinct LPWAN technologies, often compared due to their similar use cases. Sigfox uses a simple and lightweight protocol focusing on minimal energy consumption and low data rates. It is more of a managed service with a global network operator model, whereas LoRaWAN allows more customization with its open protocol standard.

### Power Consumption

Sigfox devices are designed to be extremely power-efficient. They typically consume very low power during data transmission, with sleep modes consuming micro-watts when the device is inactive. This power efficiency can enable Sigfox devices to operate for many years on a small battery, depending on the transmission frequency and environmental conditions.

### Use Cases

- **Asset Tracking**: Monitoring the location and status of valuable assets such as vehicles, shipping containers, or livestock.
- **Smart Metering**: Collecting periodic readings from utility meters (water, gas, electricity) with minimal infrastructure costs.
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Gathering data from remote sensors for applications in agriculture, wildlife monitoring, or air quality assessment.
- **Security**: Implementing remote monitoring for security systems, providing alerts when unauthorized access or disturbances are detected.
- **Industrial IoT**: Enabling predictive maintenance by sending alerts on equipment status and performance metrics.

### Limitations

- **Data Throughput**: Sigfox supports very small data packets with a limit on the number of daily transmissions, which may not be suitable for applications requiring frequent data updates or large data amounts.
- **Latency**: The network’s uplink-addressed transmission frequency may introduce latency, making it less ideal for real-time applications.
- **Bidirectional Communication**: While basic downlink communication is supported, it is limited compared to uplink capabilities.
- **Geographical Coverage**: Although Sigfox provides wide coverage in many areas, its global coverage may still have gaps, requiring localized infrastructure support.
- **Network Operator Dependence**: As a managed service, users depend on Sigfox’s network operators for infrastructure support, which may limit control compared to private network solutions like LoRaWAN.

Overall, Sigfox is an efficient LPWAN solution best suited for IoT applications requiring low-cost, long-range, and low-power operations with modest data requirements. However, its limitations in terms of data throughput and network dependency must be considered during the design phase of an IoT system.
