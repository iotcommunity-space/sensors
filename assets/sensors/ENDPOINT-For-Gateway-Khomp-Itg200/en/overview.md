# Technical Overview: ENDPOINT for Gateway Khomp ITG200

## Introduction
The ENDPOINT for the Khomp ITG200 is a versatile and efficient IoT sensor designed for seamless integration with the Khomp ITG200 gateway. It facilitates the collection and transmission of various environmental data using the LoRaWAN communication protocol. The device is engineered for applications ranging from industrial to agricultural domains, leveraging low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) technologies to ensure robust data connectivity over extensive distances.

## Working Principles
The ENDPOINT device operates by utilizing multiple embedded sensors to monitor environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, air quality, and pressure. Once data is collected, it undergoes preprocessing to ensure it is structured correctly for transmission. The device then uses the LoRaWAN standard to send the data to the Khomp ITG200 gateway, which processes the data further or forwards it to cloud services for analysis and storage. The use of LoRaWAN ensures low-power consumption, ideal for scenarios demanding extended battery life.

### LoRaWAN Details
- **Frequency Bands**: Supports multiple regional frequencies as stipulated by the LoRa Alliance, including EU868, US915, AS923, among others.
- **Data Rate**: Adaptive data rate management is implemented to optimize power usage and network capacity.
- **Transmission Range**: The sensor can transmit data over a range of up to 15 kilometers in open rural environments and up to 5 kilometers in dense urban conditions.
- **Security**: Uses end-to-end AES-128 encryption to ensure data integrity and confidentiality during transmission.

## Installation Guide
1. **Site Selection**: Choose a location that provides optimal coverage for LoRaWAN connectivity and proper environmental exposure relevant to the monitoring needs.
2. **Mounting**: Securely mount the device using the provided brackets, ensuring the sensors are exposed adequately to capture accurate readings.
3. **Powering the Device**: Insert the batteries or connect to a suitable DC power source. Check that the power supply meets the specifications indicated in the device manual.
4. **Configuration**: Utilize the Khomp device management software to register and configure the ENDPOINT on the Khomp ITG200 gateway. Set up parameters such as data transmission intervals and unique device identifiers (DevEUI, AppEUI, AppKey).
5. **Testing and Calibration**: Conduct initial tests to ensure data is accurately captured and transmitted. Calibrate sensors if necessary based on the manufacturer's instructions.

## Power Consumption
The ENDPOINT is designed for ultra-low power consumption, supporting battery-powered operations for several years, depending on data transmission intervals and environmental conditions. Typical power consumption is approximately:
- **Sleep Mode**: 0.5 µA
- **Active Sensing Mode**: 2 mA
- **Transmission Mode**: 40 mA for short bursts during LoRaWAN communication

## Use Cases
- **Agricultural Monitoring**: Track soil moisture, temperature, and humidity to optimize irrigation and crop yield.
- **Smart Cities**: Deploy throughout urban areas to monitor air quality, temperature fluctuations, or noise levels.
- **Industrial Applications**: Use for environmental monitoring in manufacturing plants to ensure compliance with safety standards.
- **Asset Tracking**: Attach to mobile assets for condition monitoring during transport.

## Limitations
- **Coverage**: Effectiveness is limited by LoRaWAN network availability and environmental obstructions that may impede signal transmission.
- **Data Rate**: Restricted bandwidth may limit the volume of data transmitted at a given time, making it unsuitable for applications needing real-time data with high throughput.
- **Environmental Constraints**: Extreme temperatures and humidity levels beyond the device’s operational range may affect sensor accuracy and device longevity.

In summary, the ENDPOINT for Khomp ITG200 is a robust and adaptable IoT sensor solution suitable for a variety of environmental monitoring applications. By utilizing LoRaWAN technology, it balances the demands of long-range communication and low power consumption effectively. However, considering its limitations regarding data rate and coverage, it is best applied in scenarios where periodic data capture suffices and network infrastructure is established.
