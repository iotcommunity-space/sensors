### Technical Overview for DAYTEC - Siglog

#### Introduction
The DAYTEC - Siglog is an advanced IoT sensor designed to monitor and transmit environmental and operational data via LoRaWAN networks. It is engineered for high accuracy, low power consumption, and robust connectivity, serving a wide range of industrial, environmental, and smart city applications.

#### Working Principles
The Siglog operates using a range of embedded microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) sensors. These sensors can measure parameters such as temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, and motion. The collected data is processed by an onboard microcontroller unit (MCU) before being encoded and transmitted over the LoRaWAN network.

Key components include:
- **Sensors**: A suite of MEMS sensors for multi-variable data acquisition.
- **MCU**: Efficient processing unit for data handling and transmission protocol management.
- **LoRa Transceiver**: Employs the LoRa modulation technique to enable long-range communication with minimal power usage.

#### Installation Guide
1. **Site Assessment**: Determine suitable placement for optimal environmental data capture and connectivity to a LoRa gateway.
2. **Mounting**: Use the provided mounting bracket or adhesive pads. Ensure the sensor is securely attached to prevent movement that could affect readings.
3. **Power Setup**: Insert the long-life lithium battery in the designated compartment. Ensure correct polarity to avoid damage.
4. **Activation**: Activate the sensor by pressing the setup button until the LED indicator blinks, signaling successful power-up and initialization.
5. **Configuration**: Use the DAYTEC smartphone application or web interface to pair the sensor with the LoRaWAN gateway. Input device-specific keys and configure data transmission intervals.
6. **Testing**: Conduct a connectivity test to ensure data is successfully being transmitted to the network server.

#### LoRaWAN Details
- **Frequency Bands**: Supports regional IoT frequencies according to LoRaWAN regional parameters (e.g., EU868, US915).
- **Data Rates**: Supports Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) to optimize communication parameters.
- **Class Type**: Primarily functions as Class A, enabling low-power end devices.
- **Security**: Utilizes end-to-end AES-128 encryption ensuring data confidentiality.

#### Power Consumption
The DAYTEC - Siglog is designed for ultra-low power operation:
- **Sleep Mode**: <10 ÂµA consumption when idle.
- **Active Mode**: Typically, <100 mA during data processing and transmission bursts.
- **Battery Life**: Typically up to 10 years, depending on environmental conditions and transmission frequency.

#### Use Cases
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Gather data on weather conditions, air quality, and climate parameters in smart cities or agriculture.
- **Industrial Applications**: Monitor equipment performance and environmental conditions in manufacturing settings.
- **Asset Tracking**: Employ motion detection and location capabilities for logistics and assets tracking within warehouses.

#### Limitations
- **Line-of-Sight Requirement**: LoRaWAN performance can degrade in environments with heavy physical obstructions.
- **Data Rate Limitations**: LoRaWAN's low data rates may not be suitable for applications requiring high throughput.
- **Local Interference**: Devices may experience interference from other RF devices operating within the same frequency band.

In summary, the DAYTEC - Siglog offers a versatile solution for a broad spectrum of applications, balancing durability, connectivity, and power efficiency. However, careful network planning and deployment considerations are essential to overcome potential limitations and achieve optimal performance.
